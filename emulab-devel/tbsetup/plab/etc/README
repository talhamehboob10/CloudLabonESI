plabroot.tgz

	The root tarball to be unpacked on to a fresh Plab sliver

key.pem, pubkey.pem

	 These are generated by plkeygen (hacked a bit so it doesn't
	 care about PIness) and allow the service manager to
	 authenticate itself.  These are used to create the request to
	 Plab central for a dslice certificate.

req.pem

	This is the plkeygen generated request that is sent to Plab.
	It's technically unnecessary to keep around after cert.pem has
	been received.

cert.pem

	The Emulab user's dslice certificate.  This allows the service
	manager to authenticate itself.  It comes from Brent Chun
	(bnc@intel-research.com), or from plkeygen:refresh, in
	response to the request created from key.pem and pubkey.pem

cacert.pem

	A certificate used by the service manager.  It comes from
	http://www.planet-lab.org/dotplanetlab/base/cacert.pem (see
	plkeygen:getbsae in the dslice source)

netbed_files

	This directory, in the install tree, will be rsync'ed to a
	directory of the same name on the plabnetlab nodes

Note that all of the *.pem files created by plkeygen are dropped in
~/.planetlab, so they have to be moved to this directory to be used.

Other important etc stuff

The Plab manager expects to find the public key to put on new nodes in
/root/.ssh/identity.pub.  This should also presumably be the pubkey
for the emulab user on Planetlab central, though this technically
doesn't matter.
