# This defines the NSENode class.  Instances of this class are created by

# This node supports a method make-simulated and when invoked with
# code in-between {} as an argument, treats the code as simulated
# and runs NSE on the physical NSENode with the provided script

# need to support simulated to real node links, simulated to simulated
# across nse nodes => we need a duplex-link specialization even in
# child interpreters

# routing must be
# manually enabled so that a RAW IP packet written should automatically
# make it out
