# Lines starting with a '#' are comments and are ignored.
# Lines starting with '=' mark a divider. A horizontal line is written at
#    that point. Anything else on the line is ignored.

# Lines starting with a '$' define a variable. Paths and filenames are
#    relative to the working directory of autocheck. Slashes are
#    automatically converted to be compatible with your os.

# All of the paths default to '.'

# Where to put the output generated by the script. This output file is
# checked against the output file with the same name in $keyOutputPath.
$trialOutputPath  tmp/result/

# This is the path where the test scripts are held.
$scriptPath  graph/

# This is where the master copies of the script output files are held.
$keyOutputPath  result/

### The three command variables must have a value.

# This is the command that is used to execute scripts.
$runCommand  bin/ipassign

# This is the command that is used to compare two output or two program files.
$compareCommand  bin/boolcmp

# Every other line must contain a word, some whitespace, then a number.
# For example (if the next line didn't have the '#'):
# word    		15

# For each value from 1 to the number, a test will be run and the following
# files will be created (relative to the current directory):

# $trialOutputPath/word1.result

# And so on for 2..14

# $trialOutputPath/word14-output.txt

# After those files are created, then comparisons are made to determine
#    whether the test passes or failed.

# If '$trialOutputPath/word?.result' is identical to
#    '$keyOutputPath/word?.result', then the output test passes.

# Where ? means the number of the test (between 1 and 15 in this case)

# Note that this means that both word and number should only contain
#    characters that can be put in a filename. And the number should
#    be an integer.

# Note if the 'zero index' flag is set, then the number range would be
# 0..14 in this example.
