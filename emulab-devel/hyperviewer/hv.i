CLASS
 HypView

 HypView is the main interface class for the HypViewer library, which
 provides layout and interactive navigation of node-link graphs in 3D
 hyperbolic space. The library can handle quite large graphs of up to
 100,000 edges quickly and with minimal visual clutter. The hyperbolic
 view allows the user to see a great deal of the context around the
 current focus node.

OVERVIEW
 
 This class is the main interface between the entire library and the
 application programmer. No get methods are documented - see the
 corresponding set method.




LAYOUT

 The HypView layout algorithm finds a spanning tree from an input
 graph and then computes a layout of that tree. A spanning tree
 touches every node in a graph, but only a subset of the links. In a
 graph a node can have many parents, but in a tree a canonical parent
 is chosen for each child. Links which appear in the graph but not in
 the spanning tree are called "non-tree links". These links do not
 affect the layout computation and are only drawn on demand for a
 selected node or nodes.
 
 The backbone spanning tree used by the layout and drawing algorithms
 strongly influences the visual impact on the user. The approach
 hinges on the idea that there are many graphs for which the right
 spanning tree can provide a useful mental model of the entire
 structure. As a fallback, a default spanning tree can always be found
 using breadth-first search from a root node. However, exploiting a
 small amount of domain-specific knowledge can allow the library to
 construct a better spanning tree which provides a more useful mental
 model. For instance, for a Web site one can use the directory
 structure encoded in the URL to choose which of the incoming
 hyperlinks to a site should be chosen as the main parent in the
 spanning tree. The specific spanning tree policies used by the
 library are controllable with the clearSpanPolicy() and
 addSpanPolicy() methods. 


DRAWING

 The HypView class has a multi layer scheme which preserves window
 system independence while providing flexibility for the application
 programmer. First, the mouse(), motion(), and passive() methods are a way
 for a window system layer to pass event loop information about the
 mouse into the HypView class. Second, the bindCallback() allows the
 application programmer to bind the main interaction functions to the
 desired mouse behavior. The setPickCallback() and
 setHiliteCallback() functions can be used to return control to
 application program callbacks when the user moves the mouse over nodes
 and links. Finally, methods like setSelected() and gotoNode() can be
 used inside the pick or highlight callbacks in the application
 program. 

 The HypView drawing algorithm depends on the number of visible, not total,
 number of nodes and edges. The projection from hyperbolic to
 euclidean space guarantees that nodes sufficiently far from the
 center will project to less than a single pixel. Thus the visual
 complexity of the scene has a guaranteed bound - only a local
 neighborhood of nodes in the graph will be visible at any given time.

 A guaranteed frame rate is extremely important for a fluid
 interactive user experience. The HypView adaptive drawing algorithm
 is designed to always maintain a target frame rate even on low-end
 graphics systems. A high constant frame rate is maintained by drawing
 only as much of the neighborhood around a center point as is possible
 in the allotted time. When the user is idle, the system fills in more
 of the surrounding scene. A slow graphics system will simply show
 less of the context surrounding the node of interest during
 interactive manipulation.
  
 The amount of time devoted to a frame should depend on the activity
 of the user. The HypView library allows separate control over the
 drawing frame time, idle frame time, and picking frame time using the
 setDynamicFrameTime(), setIdleFrameTime(), and setPickFrameTime()
 methods. The dynamic frame time is simply the time budget in which to
 draw a single frame during user mouse movement or an animated
 transition. It is clear that the drawing time should be explicitly
 bounded instead of increasing as the node/edge count rises. The time
 spent casting pick rays into the scene must be similarly bounded.
 When the user and application are idle, the system can fill in more
 of the surrounding scene. However, the time spent on this, the idle
 frame time, should still be bounded to eventually free the CPU for
 other tasks.


INITIALIZATION

 Most functions have no effect or return NULL if called after a
 HypView object is instantiated but before the setGraph member is
 called. However, the following functions can be successfully called
 even before the first setGraph() call:

addSpanPolicy(), 
bindCallback(), 
clearSpanPolicy(), 
getDynamicFrameTime(),
getIdleFrameTime(),
getPickFrameTime(),
getSphere(),
getEdgeSize(),
getLabels(),
getLabelSize(),
getLabelFont(),
getPassiveCull(),
getMotionCull(),
getAreaFudge(),
getLengthFudge(),
getLeafRad(),
getMaxLength(),
getGenerationNodeLimit(),
getGenerationLinkLimit(),
getCenterShow(),
getCenterLargest(),
getNegativeHide(),
getSpanPolicy(),
getGotoStepSize(),
getTossEvents(),
getWidget(),
setCenterLargest(), 
setCenterShow(), 
setColorHilite(), 
setColorSelect(), 
setColorLabel(),
setColorLinkFrom(), 
setColorLinkTo().
setEdgeSize(),
setGenerationNodeLimit(), 
setGenerationLinkLimit(), 
setGotoStepSize(),
setGroupKey(),
setHiliteCallback(),
setKeepAspect(), 
setLabels(), 
setLabelSize(), 
setLabelToRight(), 
setLeafRad(),
setLinkPolicy(),
setMaxLength(), 
setNegativeHide(), 
setMotionCull(), 
setPassiveCull(), 
setPickCallback(), 
setSphere(),
setTossEvents(), 
setDynamicFrameTime(), 
setIdleFrameTime(),
setPassiveFrameTime(), 

 The following functions cannot be called until after the window is shown,
 since they depend on having a graphics context:
drawFrame(), 
redraw(), 
reshape(),



INPUT FILE FORMAT

 Each line of the input file is of the form

<pre>
  depth identifier 1 group1 [group2 ... groupN]
</pre>

with the following types

<pre>
  int string int string [string ... string]
</pre>

 Each line corresponds to a node. The order of the lines is
 meaningful. The integer at the beginning of the line is the depth in
 the tree. A line with depth one greater than the line above it
 indicates a link between two nodes from the line above to the line
 below. The identifier strings are assumed to uniquely specify a node.
 If an identifier occurs twice that means a node has more than one
 incoming link, so the file describes a general graph, as opposed to a
 tree or a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The identifier string is used
 as an interface between the library and the application program in
 many methods which have the argument "string & id".

 A file with structure like

<pre>

0       A   [...]
1       B   [...]
2       C   [...]
3       D   [...]
4       A   [...]
3       E   [...]
2       F   [...]
1       G   [...]
1       H   [...]
2       I   [...]
2       J   [...]
1       K   [...]

</pre>

corresponds to a graph that looks like:

<pre>

  .-------- A
 /      ____|_______
 |     /   |   \    |
 |    B    G    H   K
 |   / \       / \
 |  C   F     I   J
 \ / \
  D   E

</pre>

 The very first node is the root, the numbers correspond to the number
 of layers deep in the hierarchy.

 The software computes a spanning tree to use as the base for layout
 and display. The addSpanPolicy() method controls the policies used to
 create this spanning tree. If the HV_SPANFOREST policy is used, then
 you can have a forest of distinct subtrees that are not mingled. The
 other policies, like HV_SPANBFS for breadth-first search, are then
 applied to each subtree independently. A forest is specified by
 having a toplevel starting root which has depth < 0. For instance,

<pre>
-1 top 1 html
 0 subtree1/root 1 html
  1 subtree1/thing1 1 html
  1 subtree1/thing2 1 html
[...]
 0 subtree2/root 1 html
  1 subtree2/thing1 1 html
  1 subtree2/thing2 1 html
</pre>

 Groups and collections are an organizational mechanism for filtering
 and coloring nodes. A node can belong to exactly one group per
 collection. In the input file, the collections correspond to columns
 and groups correspond to the values which are in the columns. A node
 can also be associated with a group in a collection with the
 setNodeGroup() method. Collections are designated by a number,
 starting with 0. There must be at least one collection, and there can
 be up to 16 different ones. Each collection can have any number of
 groups. Group names are designated by text strings and can be used in
 different collections. Any group in a collection can be disabled.
 A node will be drawn if none of its associated groups have been disabled. 
 Groups are enabled by default and may be explicitly  disabled/reenabled 
 by the application program using the setDisableGroup() method.
 Each group in each collection can have a color assigned to it with
 the setColorGroup() method. The setGroupKey() method allows the
 application program to change which of the collections is used for
 coloring. 

 For example, the file

<pre>

 0 http://hyper/ 1 html main
 1 http://hyper/index.html html main
 1 http://hyper/logo.gif image main
 1 http://hyper/old.html html orphan

</pre>

 with the following code in the application 

<pre>

  hv->setColorGroup(0, "image", .42, 0, .48);
  hv->setColorGroup(0, "html", 0, 1, 1);
  hv->setColorGroup(1, "main", 1, 1, 1);
  hv->setColorGroup(1, "orphan", .2, .2, .2);

  hv->setDisbleGroup(1, "orphan", 0);
  hv->setGroupKey(0);

</pre>

 would result in three visible nodes, colored by collection 0: the
 logo.gif node would be colored purple and the index.html and
 top-level hyper nodes would be colored cyan. The old.html node would
 not be drawn since the orphan group is disabled.


 Finally, the third item in the input file line must be an integer,
 which should be set 1 (for historical reasons).


DEPENDENCIES

 The HypView libraries are written in C++ and use OpenGL/Mesa and STL.
 There is a small amount of OS/window system dependent code which is
 segregated by "ifdef"s. The three main flavors are Unix XWindows and
 Microsoft Windows, and GLUT. The XWindows version is tagged as "GLX"
 in the Makefiles and has two flavors: Xt and ViewKit. Xt is probably
 the most useful version. ViewKit is a library built on top of Xt (so
 the code is quite similar) which is most popular under Irix, but has
 been ported to other platforms. The libraries were originally written
 under ViewKit, so there are a lot of historical "vk" tags still lying
 around despite the fact that Xt is now the main version.

 GLUT is a window-system independent library from Mark Kilgard
 (formerly of SGI), downloadable from
 http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/glut3/glut3.html. It should
 theoretically be able to run under Windows but has only been tested
 under Irix. The GLUT version is simpler than the Xt one but not as
 powerful, which unsurprisingly mirrors the relationship of GLUT and
 Xt/ViewKit.

 The Windows version has been tested on Windows NT under Visual C++.
 The Borland version has not been tested for a while. 

MAKEFILES

 Select the appropriate flavor of OS and window system by uncommenting
 the relevant line in Makefile.main, then edit the relevant Makefile
 for your system to make sure all paths are set correctly for your system.
