# Add class to vlans. Note that we now support experimental vlans on
# the control network via trunk links. Thus the stack and the class
# can actually be different. But we need to store this in the vlans
# table cause of swapmod and syncvlansfromtables, since there might
# not be a lans table entry if the lan is stale and needs to be
# destroyed. We can probably get by without this, but I like having
# it be explicit when looking at the vlans table, and since the table
# is not tha big, the extra slot is no big deal.
