This file documents the process of adding a new node to the testbed.

A. Information about the node
-----------------------------

1. MAC address. For each port in the new node you need to find out the
   MAC address, and which port (eth0/fxp0) it is in software.  You need
   to know both the Linux (eth) and BSD (fxp,xl,dc,etc.) names.

2. Wiring. We need to know which physical port on the back of the
   machine maps to eth0, eth1, etc., and where each port is connected
   to the cisco (get module/port, ie 3/21).

3. Power. Plug it into a power controller, and make note of which one
   it is (name or IP) and which port you plug it into (1-8).

4. Serial line(s). When you plug in the serial lines, make sure which
   ports on the serial expander they are plugged into.

B. If the node is of a new type
-------------------------------

1. You'll need specs on the nodes for the node_types and node_type_attributes
   tables. For node_types, you'll just need a name for the type:

   insert into `node_types` (class,type) values ("pc", "pc2800d");

   For node_type_attributes you will create a row for each of several
   attributes.  For this, you will need a name for the processor class
   (e.g. Core Duo), speed (MHz), RAM size (in MB), boot hard disk type and unit
   ('ad' and '0' for IDE, 'da' and '0' for SCSI, 'ad' and '4' for SATA),
   boot disk size (in GB), max # of physical cards it holds (including the
   motherboard as a card if it has built-in ethernet), and the approximate
   amount of time it takes the machine to "power cycle" (in seconds).

   You'll also need to give it a default OS id (the default OS to boot)
   and image ID (disk image the default OS comes from), which port is the
   control net (e.g. 4) and what its Linux name is (e.g. "eth4"), how many
   links this node can delay (usually: num_experimental_links / 2), and
   how many virtual nodes ("jails") the machine can support.

   Example:

   insert into `node_type_attributes` values
     ('pc2800d','processor','Pentium D','string'),
     ('pc2800d','frequency','2800','integer'),
     ('pc2800d','memory','2048','integer'),
     ('pc2800d','disktype','ad','string'),
     ('pc2800d','bootdisk_unit','4','integer'),
     ('pc2800d','disksize','160.00','float'),
     ('pc2800d','max_interfaces','4','integer'),
     ('pc2800d','power_delay','60','integer'),
     ('pc2800d','default_imageid','emulab-ops-FBSD54+FC4-STD','string'),
     ('pc2800d','default_osid','emulab-ops-FBSD54','string'),
     ('pc2800d','control_network','0','integer'),
     ('pc2800d','control_interface','eth0','string'),
     ('pc2800d','delay_capacity','2','integer'),
     ('pc2800d','virtnode_capacity','50','integer');

   There are also assorted other attributes you need not change, just
   use these:

   insert into `node_type_attributes` values
     ('pc2800d','delay_osid','FBSD-STD','string'),
     ('pc2800d','jail_osid','FBSD-STD','string'),
     ('pc2800d','adminmfs_osid','FREEBSD-MFS','string'),
     ('pc2800d','diskloadmfs_osid','FRISBEE-MFS','string'),
     ('pc2800d','pxe_boot_path','/tftpboot/pxeboot.emu','string'),
     ('pc2800d','imageable','1','boolean'),
     ('pc2800d','rebootable','1','boolean'),
     ('pc2800d','simnode_capacity','0','integer'),
     ('pc2800d','trivlink_maxspeed','0','integer');


2. There are several scripts that limit searches to certain classes.
   If the new type you have added does not have class "pc", you may need
   to include this new class as appropriate.
   Some of the scripts that might need to be updated are:
   /db/avail.in
   /db/nfree.in
   /tbsetup/assign_wrapper.in
   /tbsetup/batchexp.in
   /tbsetup/reload_daemon.in
   /tbsetup/exports_setup.in
   /tbsetup/snmpit_lib.pm
   /www/nodecontrol_list.php3
   /www/reserved.php3
   /www/showexp_list.php3
   /www/tutorial/nscommands.html
   /www/updown.php3
   /sql/database-create.sql

C. What to do on boss:
----------------------

1. Insert entries into interfaces table using info from A(1). Try:
   insert into interfaces (node_id,card,port,MAC,IP,interface_type,iface)
   values
   ("pcN",0,1,"00b0d0f01020",NULL,"BSDTYPE","eth0")  

2. Insert entries into wires table using info from A(2). Try:
   insert into wires (node_id1,card1,port1,node_id2,card2,port2) values
   ("pcN",0,1,"ciscoX",5,1)

   For the control interface do:
   insert into wires (type,node_id1,card1,port1,node_id2,card2,port2)
   values ("Control","pcN",0,1,"ciscoX",5,1)

   Check to make sure your cards and ports match up with what you 
   entered in the interfaces table.

3. Insert entry into outlets table, using info from A(3). Try:
   insert into outlets (node_id, power_id, outlet) values
   ("pcN","powerX",Y)

4. Add entries to the nodes table for each node. Try:
   insert into nodes (node_id,type,phys_nodeid,role,def_boot_osid,priority,op_mode)
   values
   ("pcN","pc1u","pcN","testnode","FBSD45-STD",P,'NORMAL')

   P (priority) is the where it gets printed out. These need to be
   ascending numbers, and in the right region. See the table.

4a. Add entries into the tiplines table. The "server" field is where
    the actual capture process runs:

    INSERT INTO tiplines VALUES ('pc1','pc1','users.emulab.net',0,0,'');
    INSERT INTO tiplines VALUES ('pc111','pc111','tipserv1.emulab.net',0,0,'');

    You need to add the usual lines in /etc/remote on the machine
    where the capture process runs. In addition, add a line on users
    to that users can use tip to connect to a console on a remote tip
    server. So, on users:

	pc111|tbpc111:dv=/dev/tip/pc111:br#115200:nt:pa=none:

    The device field is ignored, but something must be there. 

5. Until you are ready to put it in service, reserve it to an expt,
   either with nalloc or by adding an entry to the reserved table
   directly. You'll probably also want to put its ports in a vlan to
   enable them.

6. Add the node to the system files:
   - DNS: on boss, cd /etc/namedb
	  co -l emulab.net.db.head
	  add these lines with all the others:
	  pcN    IN      A       155.101.132.N
                 IN      MX 10   ops
                 IN      MX 20   fast.cs.utah.edu.
	  ci -u emulab.net.db.head
          cd reverse/
	  co -l 155.101.132.db
	  in 155.101.132.db, make these changes:
	  update serial number on line 10
	  add entry for node, like this:
	  N      IN      PTR     pcN.emulab.net.
	  ci -u 155.101.132.db
	  run /usr/testbed/sbin/named_setup to update.
   - DHCP: on boss, cd /usr/local/etc/
	   if you added a new node type, then you need to add a line
	   of the form:
	      %%nodetype=<type>
	   (where <type> is the new type is called) to dhcpd.conf.template.
	   Then as root run:
	      dhcpd_makeconf dhcpd.conf.template > Ndhcpd.conf
	   you can diff dhcpd.conf with the new file to verify nothing
           catostrophic happened.  Finally:
	      sudo cp Ndhcpd.conf dhcpd.conf
	      sudo /usr/local/etc/rc.d/2.dhcpd.sh restart 
   - tip: on ops or tipserv1, edit /etc/remote
	  add a line like this:
	  pcN:dv=/dev/tip/pcN:br#115200:nt:pa=none:
	  pcN-tty:dv=/dev/cua<port #>:br#115200:nt:pa=none:
	  then do these:
	  sudo touch /var/log/tiplogs/pcN.log
	  sudo touch /var/log/tiplogs/pcN.run
   - capture: on ops or tipserv1, edit /usr/site/etc/capture.rc:
	  add a line like this:
	  /usr/site/bin/capture -r -s 115200 pcN tty<port#> >/dev/null 2>&1 &


D. How to get the first image on it:
------------------------------------

1. If everything is set up right, you can use the magic PXE Flash Floppy 
   to put the right thing on the PXE card. Edit the BIOS to put the
   boot order to Floppy, PXE, Hard Drive, then reboot it.

2. If everything goes right, you should see it PXE boot and find its
   DHCP info, then contact the ProxyDHCP server to get its bootinfo
   data, then it should decide according to that what to boot.

3. If process 3 went okay to that point, do an os_load to try to
   install the standard testbed images for the node.

4. If it doesn't seem to be working just like the others, talk to
   Leigh and Mike.

E. What next
------------

1. Test it out and see if it works well enough to put into service. If
   its ready, release it into the wild with nfree or by deleting its
   entry in the reserved table.

2. Do some more tests to find any obvious problems. Fix them, if any.

3. Sit back and relax for a few minutes until the bug reports start
   flowing in.
