March 14, 2001: Add a -B option to use Vbat for Vcore1
	with W83782D style chips (Abit BP6).  Submitted by:
	Trev Roydhouse <trev@sentry.org>

Janurary 5, 2001: Changes to allow healthdc to compile on 
	version without IPv6 support.

October 10, 2000: Thanks to Archie Cobbs <archie@whistle.com>
	For submitting a patch for the Winbond W83627HF

October 3, 2000: IANA has assigned me an official port of 1281.
	That is different for 9669 that was used origionally.
	-P 9669 can be used to specify the old port number.

September 29, 2000: Thanks to Claus Assmann <ca+healthd@esmtp.org>
	for another patch to allow ISA mode to work on OpenBSD.

September 14, 2000:
	Change the printing of daemon error from stderr to using
	syslog.

	Only enable the reading of the doWarn and doFail settings
	and the contents of the *_warn and *_fail scripts if
	compiled with -DFULL_CONFIG or ./configure --enable-full-config.
	This is because I beleive that the information might provide
	information that might be useful in exploiting the machine.

September 13, 2000:
	Protocol 2.0.  Enables obtaining version and configuration
	information from the running daemon.

September 11, 2000:
	IPv6 support added to healthd and healthdc.  IPv6
	support also works for libwrap.

August 20, 2000: Thanks to Claus Assmann <ca+healthd@esmtp.org>
	for a patch to allow ISA mode to work on OpenBSD.

	Thanks to Stefan Moeding <s.moeding@ndh.net> for the 
	origional version of the code to allow external programs
	to be run on warnings and failures.  It has since then
	been greatly extended.

June 5, 2000:  If there was no config file in the default locatiion
	healthd was exiting before -f could read a specified config
	file.  (thanks: Andre Albsmeier <andre.albsmeier@mchp.siemens.de>)

April 26, 2000: Changed ReadConfigFile() & ParseOption() to not display
	unknown options, instead display the line number.  This prevents
	the user from using healthd to display files the user doesn't have
	permission to read.  (thanks: Volker Stolz 
	<stolz@Pool.Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE>)

April 9, 2000: Added -c option (thanks: David McNett <nugget@distributed.net>)

March 25, 2000: Fix root exploit (thanks: Valentin Nechayev 
	<netch@@segfault.kiev.au>)

January 20, 2000: Added -1 and -2 for the Winbond 83781 and 83782
	chips respectively (Adrian Murphy)

November 15, 1999: Added healthd.8 man file.

November 7, 1999: Added -f to override default config file.

October 29, 1999: Initial Release 0.1
