-- SQL extra defs for setting Flyspray from ops-install
--

-- Okay, as I started to do the Emulab to Flyspray interface, I
-- realized I need to add a new table to map between Emulab pid and
-- Flyspray project. Not a problem for users or groups, but Flyspray
-- allows people to edit the project names, which would make it
-- impossible for Emulab to find the right records later.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS emulab_project_mapping (
  pid varchar(32) NOT NULL default '',
  flyspray_id mediumint(5) NOT NULL default '0',
  PRIMARY KEY  (pid)
) TYPE=MyISAM;


-- Needed for cross-login (xlogin) support. 

alter table flyspray_users add cred varchar(40) default NULL;


-- In the default project, turn off the view bit for Basic users; That
-- project is silly and no one should see it, since the only way to
-- change permissions for it is to give users permission across all
-- projects.

update flyspray_projects set others_view='0' where project_id='1';
