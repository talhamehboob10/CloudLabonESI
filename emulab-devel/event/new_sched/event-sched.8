.SH NAME
event-sched \- The testbed event scheduler.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI event-sched

[\fB-l \fIlogfile\fR]
[\fB-k \fIkeyfile\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B event-sched
daemon is responsible for sending events to its experiment at predetermined
times as well as handling some of the events internally.  For example, if the
NS file for an experiment contains:
.P
.RS
$ns at 60.0 "$ns swapout"
.RE
.P
The deamon will send a "SWAPOUT" event 60 seconds after the experiment finished
swapping in.  And, since the daemon also handles this event, it will start the
swap out.  Events not handled internally are delivered to the appropriate
"event agents" running on the experimental nodes.  In addition to the NS file,
events can be sent dynamically using the
.B tevc\fR(1)
utility.
.P
A separate
.B event-sched
daemon is automatically started and stopped when an experiment is swapped in
and out, or you can manually start/stop/replay the daemon using the
.B eventsys_control\fR(1)
utility.
.P
Available options:
.P
.TP
.B -h
Print out a usage message.
.TP
.B -V
Print out version information and exit.
.TP
.B -d
Turn on debugging messages.
.TP
.B -s \fIserver
The host name where the elvind server is running. (Default: localhost)
.TP
.B -p \fIport
The port the elvind server is listening on.
.TP
.B -l \fIlogfile
The path of the log file, if none is specified output will go to standard out.
.TP
.B -k \fIkeyfile
The path of the experiment's private symmetric key used to sign/verify events.
(Default:
/proj/\fIpid\fR/exp/\fIeid\fR/tbdata/eventkey)
.SH FILES
.TP
/proj/\fIpid\fR/exp/\fIeid\fR/logs/event-sched.log
