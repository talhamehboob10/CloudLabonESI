NOTICE: The "measured_by" field in the table "pair_data" is
a short integer... should be longer (?)


TODO:
2) Change bgmon queuing so that different tools of the
same class do not overwrite each other.
3) Add generalization into the managerclient
4) Make Iperfwrapper do the iperf timeout stuff.
5) move probe "target" into the actual param list? NO:
   don't want a new entry in tool_idx for every destination!
6) make "outage detection system" a separate tool.

Data Collector
Gets result packet from path prober, containing extra
info about the tool type and actual parameters used.
Find the proper ToolID in the "ToolParamTable" indexing with
toolname and actual_params. If no match, add new entry
with new ID number.



Manager:
For now, just "hardwires" the tool parameters so that the
managerclient does not need to be changed

Managerclient:
no changes for now.


Wrapper scripts for iperf, fping, and ping:
- iperf
  - input: list of arguments, e.g.:  duration=5,target=plab222
  - output: result, e.g: 500
wrapper executes actual tool with appropriate command-lines
wrapper outputs a key-value pair of results and error codes.


Path Prober:  
  
bgmon.pl receives probe request:
cmdtype: INIT
toolname: iperf
type: one-shot
duration: 12000
wrapper_path: /tmp/iperfwrapper
required_params: target=plab222,period=600,port=6666,duration=5
optional_params: 

bgmon.pl stores request into "testevents"
Test is started at appropriate time by running the wrapper_path with the argument fields. Wrapper output read from file, as is currently done.
