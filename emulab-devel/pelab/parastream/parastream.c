/**
 * this app has two modes:
 * first, simply accepts strings of the form on stdin
 *   INTERVAL=%d BLOCKSIZE=%d DURATION=%d
 * where INTERVAL's value is in milliseconds, and BLOCKSIZE's value
 * is in bytes, and DURATION's value is in seconds (if DURATION is 0, keep
 * going until we see the next event on stdin); and adjusts its packet send
 * rates accordingly as soon as it receives the strings.
 * 
 * second, if you specify a file, each line should contain repeated 
 * strings like
 *   INTERVAL=%d BLOCKSIZE=%d STARTTIME=%d DURATION=%d
 * where STARTTIME is a time offset from program start.  When each line's
 * STARTTIME is reached, the previous event (if any) is terminated, and
 * we start sending packets at the new rate specified by INT and BS.
 * 
 * in this second mode, you can also specify DURATION instead of STARTTIME;
 * DURATION's value is also in seconds; as soon as that DURATION has elapsed,
 * we start sending packets at the next INTERVAL and BLOCKSIZE specified in
 * the file, if any.  If DURATION's value is 
 *
 * also: if run in first modes, does NOT DO ANYTHING until it sees something
 * on std input... only connects to server.
