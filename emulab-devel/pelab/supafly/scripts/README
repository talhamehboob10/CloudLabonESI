README File for using the scripts to analyze the logs of the supafly 
application.

CONTENTS OF THE CHECKOUT:
1) The checked out directory contains the log files generated by profiling the 
   supafly application on Emulab, Planetlab and Pelab. These are in the 
   respective "logs_<name_of_lab>" subdirectories.

2) There is also a sample set of logs in the "logs_sample" subdirectory.

3) The main PERL script is the "log_analyzer.pl" file.

4) There is also a shell script file called "plot.sh" that contains Gnuplot 
   commands to plot the graphs. This shell script gets called by the above 
   PERL script. The shell script was written to automate the process of 
   generating the graphs.


RUNNING THE SCRIPT:
1) The checked in version of the script will run fine and generate the graphs 
   for the logs_emulab, logs_pelab and the logs_sample log files.

   NOTE: To run it on the logs_planetlab a slight modification has to be done!
         This is explained in Step 3.

   The following example shows how to run the script on the Emulab logs.

   USAGE  : ./log_analyzer.pl <middleman> <sender> <receiver> <<fillme>lab>

   EXAMPLE:

   % ./log_analyzer.pl logs_emulab/middleman.log logs_emulab/sender.log 
     logs_emulab/receiver.log emulab


2) You must provide all the four command line arguments. Running the script 
   will create a generated/<<fillme>lab> subdirectory and place all the 
   generated data(.dat) and graph(.eps) files there. The following files will
   be generated for the above emulab example.

   a) emulab.dat - This is the data file fed to Gnuplot. It contains two 
                   columns, "middleman timestamps in diffs" and 
                   "(receiverTS - senderTS)"

   b) emulab_stat_file - This contains statistical information like the max,
                   min, mean, variance and standard deviation of three 
                   datasets:  the perceived duration at the middleman
                              the timestamps recorded at the middleman
                              the (rcvTS-sndTS) computed at sender and receiver

   c) emulab_lag.eps - The plot of the "(rcvTS-sndTS)" on the Y-axis against 
                   the "timestamp diffs recorded at the middleman" on the 
                   X-axis. All values are in seconds.    
   
   d) There are some other generated temporary files as well. Ignore those.


3) To run the script for the checked in Planetlab logs, modify the 
   "log_analyzer.pl" script at the section marked "NOTE" in the source code.
   Instructions on commenting and uncommenting are provided in the source code
   itself.
