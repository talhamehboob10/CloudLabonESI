/*
 * This structure is placed in the boot block. The loader reads the
 * structure to determine whether it should boot from CDROM or switch
 * to the disk.
 *
 * The basic idea is this:
 *
 * 1. The node always boots from the CD-ROM (first in boot chain).
 * 2. The loader looks for this magic structure:
 *     2a: If not present continues to load from the CD-ROM (step 4).
 *     2b: If present check the contents of the structure. If directed to
 *         boot from the disk goto step 3. If not, continues to load from
 *         the CDROM (step 4).
 * 3. Boot from the disk. Switch the boot device to the disk so that the
 *    kernel is loaded from the disk. Also reset the flag (written to disk)
 *    to indicate that next reboot should happen from the CDROM. Also set
 *    another flag, cleared by the kernel, that indicates the kernel booted
 *    okay. This avoids reboot loops in the case of a scrogged disk.
 * 4. Boot from the CD-ROM. The user level code on the CD-ROM will take care
 *    of the rest, writing the proper flags to the structure on the disk.
 *    Normally, this means checking in with Emulab, and then setting the flag
 *    to cause it to boot from the disk.
 *
 * This entire structure has to be less than a sector.
