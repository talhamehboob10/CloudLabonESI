README for RobFastCntToLedsAndRfm

Modified version of the standard CntToLedsAndRfm that counts (almost) at 10Hz,
and with a different power level. Due to the fact that TinyOS timers us binary
milliseconds (1024 per second, not 1000), it counts at 10.04 Hz.

Modified from the standard CntToLedsAndRfm by ricci@cs.utah.edu
