NetBuild requires Java.

If you want to use NetBuild,
you should either enable Java in your browser 
or use the latest version of a Java-compliant browser 
(such as Mozilla, Netscape or Internet Explorer.)

Once you've gotten your Java on, 
please come back and enjoy NetBuild.
We'll still be here waiting for you.
