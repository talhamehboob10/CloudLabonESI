    <dd>An emulated experiment allows you to specify an arbitrary network
    topology, giving you a <em>controllable, predictable, and repeatable
    environment</em>, including PC nodes on which you have
    <em>full &quot;root&quot; access</em>, running an operating system of
    your choice.</dd>

    <dt><a href="/wikidocs/wiki/plab">Live-Internet Experimentation</a></dt>
    <dd>Using the RON and <a href="http://www.planet-lab.org">PlanetLab</a>
    testbeds, Emulab provides you with a
    <em>full-featured environment</em> for <em>deploying, running, and
    controlling</em> your application at hundreds of sites around the
    world.</dd>

    <dt><a href="/wikidocs/wiki/wireless">802.11 Wireless</a></dt>
    <dd>Emulab's 802.11a/b/g testbed is deployed on multiple floors of an
    office building. Nodes are <em>under your full control</em> and may act as
    access points, clients, or in ad-hoc mode. All nodes have two wireless
    interfaces, plus a <em>wired control network</em>.</dd>

    <dt><a href="/wikidocs/wiki/gnuradio">Software-Defined Radio</a></dt>
    <dd><a href="http://www.ettus.com/downloads/usrp_v4.pdf">USRP</a> devices from the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuradio/index.html">GNU Radio</a> project give you <em>control over Layer 1 of a
    wireless network</em> - everything from signal processing up is done in
    software.</dd>

    </dl>

<p>
Emulab unifies all of these environments under a common user interface,
and integrates them into a common framework.  This framework
provides abstractions, services, and namespaces common to all, such as
allocation and naming of nodes and links.  By mapping the abstractions
into domain-specific mechanisms and internal names, Emulab masks much
of the heterogeneity of the different resources.
