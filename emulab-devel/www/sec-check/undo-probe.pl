# undo-probe.pl - Common code to undo probes to setup/teardown pages.

# Often, an automated SQL injection probe DOESN'T FAIL, due to the page logic
# ignoring the probe value given for the input field, or not using the probe
# label unquoted in an SQL query.  E.g, the first beginexp that succeeds uses
# up the experiment name and blocks all other probes, hence the experiment has
# to be deleted before the next probe can be done.
# 
# This script assists with the timing problems of doing that.  One problem is
# that many setup pages return at the beginning of their actions, and leave
# spewlogfile, et. al. to show the results.  Wget doesn't wait for the spew to
# finish, so there's trouble if the probe script marches on to the next probe.
# Another problem is that the undo actions also take time, and we don't want
# to go on to the next probe until the cleanup action is finished, either.
# 
# The approach here is to check the database or file state on MYBOSS (the
# inner Emulab controller) and proceed when that has been changed.  Logic to
# do that for each of the object types we use to exercise the pages is in the
# cases below.
