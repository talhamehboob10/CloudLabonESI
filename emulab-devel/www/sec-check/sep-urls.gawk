# sep-urls - Separate out the setup and teardown URL's.
# 
#   Input is in two parts, concatenated: 
#     . An ordered list of .php3 filenames, with interspersed action lines.
#       - PHP filename lines have a / at the front to anchor them for
#         uniqueness.
#       - Comment lines are prefixed by a "#".
#       - Action lines are prefixed by a "!" or "-".  See urls-to-wget.gawk
#         for further descriptions.
#       - Leading whitespace on lines is removed, so actions can be indented.
#
#     . Then the URL's to be separated out and ordered according to the list.
#
#   Output is the subset of URL's corresponding to the file list, in order,
#   with action lines added.  Meant to be fed to urls-to-wget.gawk .
#
#   A -v SYSADMIN= awk arg specifies the administrator login name to use.
