=== DISK AGENT ===

Currently, a couple of things needs to be taken care of before we can run 
disk-agent. Those are,

1. Need to fix all the library paths in compile.sh to point to the correct location
2. For linking to devmapper library, we need to copy the libdevmapper.so.* to /lib/
3. Need to change the perl script run.pl to point to the right experiment name
