# XXX this is an Emulab-only script to optimize the upload process.
# Since the master server runs on boss, but most images live on ops,
# we wind up writing images across the network twice: once uploading to
# boss and then again writing the image across NFS to ops.
#
# Note that this same problem exists for frisbeed and multicasting images,
# so this should really be generalized to handle that as well.
