These are files to support building jails on freebsd machines.
They go in /etc/jail on the host machine. Other support is scattered
in the parent directory and in ../ron.

There is a dup set of passwd/group files here that are used inside the
jail. This ensures that the user (who might be root) does not get a
password file with anything important in it.
