# StateWait.pm
#
# A library for waiting for nodes to reach certain states.
#
# $rv = initStateWait(\@states, @nodes);
#
# Call this first. Make sure to call it _before_ performing any
# action that may trigger one or more of the states you're
# expecting to see. Each node must see the list of states in the
# proper order, ie if @states=(stateA, stateB), it will not
# complete until the first time stateB is seen after stateA has
# been seen. Returns 0 on success.
#
# $rv = waitForState(\@finished, \@failed[, $timeout);
#
# Do the actual waiting. Blocks until each node has either reached the
# desired state(s) or failed, or timeout is reached (if given and
# non-zero). Returns lists of nodes.
#
# $rv = cancelWait($node);
#
# "Nevermind..." for state waiting. Returns 0 on success.
#
# $rv = endStateWait();
#
# Stop listening for states. Call this soon after waitForState.
# This must be called before calling initStateWait again.
