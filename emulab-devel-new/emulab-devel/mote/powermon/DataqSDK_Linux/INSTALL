DataqSDK 1.0 (beta) for Linux

Refer to the README first.

BUILDING THE LIBRARY:

[DataqSDK]$ make

-for static binary:
  [DataqSDK]$ make static

-for shared binary:
  [DataqSDK]$ make shared

  *you may need to install the shared library, unless you plan on linking
   it yourself
  *ROOT OPERATION (use "su" to become root)

  [DataqSDK]# make install

  *to go back to normal user, use "exit"

*Note: to install the precompiled shared library, first move it to the
"DataqSDK" directory and then perform the "make install"

*Note: to uninstall the library, do the following as root:
  [DataqSDK]# make uninstall

BUILDING EXAMPLE PROGRAM:

-Static library:
  1) Copy the precompiled static library (*.a) to the example directory:
      [dataqsdk_example]$ cp ../DataqSDK/precompiled/libdataqsdk.a .
  2) Build the example:
      [dataqsdk_example]$ make static-example
    *Note: The shared library must not be installed for the static library to
           work properly.
  3) Example program usage: ./static-example [sample rate] [scans] [channels]
      [dataqsdk_example]$ ./static-example 240.00 100 5

-Shared library:
  1) Copy the precompiled shared library (*.so.*) to the "DataqSDK" directory:
      [DataqSDK]$ cp precompiled/libdataqsdk.so.0.0 .
  2) Install the library:
      [DataqSDK]$ make install
      *Note: This must be done as root.
  3) Build the example:
      [dataqsdk_example]$ make shared-example
  4) Example program usage: ./shared-example [sample rate] [scans] [channels]
      [dataqsdk_example]$ ./shared-example 240.00 100 5


*You may also use the precompiled example binaries in the "precompiled"
directory. Note, however, that the shared library must still be installed
before it can be used by the shared-example program.
