DataqSDK 1.0 (beta) for Linux

This library is currently being developed and still considered as beta.
The only devices supported are the DI-194RS and DI-154RS. Note, however,
that only a small subsection of the DataqSDK's functions are supported by
the two devices and not all of them are implemented.

Documentation may be found in the "docs/html/index.html" HTML page along
with other autogenerated documentation by Doxygen. You may also refer to
the source code itself for further documentation not included in the
HTML pages.

To start using the example program, you may use the precompiled static example
found in the "dataqsdk_example/precompiled" directory, "static-example".
usage: ./static-example [sample rate] [scans] [channels]
example: ./static-example 240.00 10 5

*Note: The precompiled binaries were built using g++ 3.3.3. In particular, the
libraries libstdc++.so.6 and libgcc_s-3.3.3-20040413.so.1 were used. These
binaries may not work properly or at all without the proper shared libraries.
libstdc++.so.6 is part of the gcc 3.3.3 compiler collection.
libgcc_s-3.3.3-20040413.so.1 may be downloaded as a separate rpm.
