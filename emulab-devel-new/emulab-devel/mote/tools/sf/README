Modified version of the TinyOS tools for dealing with mote serial communication.

In order to build ARM versions of these tools, you need arm-linux-gcc
in your path. At the time of writing, this can be found on the
RHL90-XSCALE-CROSS disk image, in /usr/local/arm/bin .

The one I've added is rssi_cnt_listen, which parses packets from the
RobTransparentBase app, which in turn receives them from any of the
CntToLedsAndRfm apps (either the standard one, or any of my modified ones.). It
understands enough of the packet formay of this app to print out the count
received and the associated RSSI.
