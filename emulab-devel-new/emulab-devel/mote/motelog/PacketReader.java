    /*
     * creates a class that decomposes an InputStream into tinyos

     * to only be used by our logger.  All the logger does is snoop
     * packets... we want to let any applications respond as necessary.
     * As it turns out, when we snoop the Elab component-generated packets,
     * we'll issue any acks then -- or let some special "elab listener" do it.

    /*
     * Here's the relevant protocol info from net.tinyos.packet.Packetizer:
     * 
     * Protocol inspired by, but not identical to, RFC 1663.
     * There is currently no protocol establishment phase, and a single
     * byte ("packet type") to identify the kind/target/etc of each packet.
     *
     * The protocol is really, really not aiming for high performance.
     * 
     * There is however a hook for future extensions: implementations are
     * required to answer all unknown packet types with a P_UNKNOWN packet.
     *
     * To summarise the protocol:
     * - the two sides (A & B) are connected by a (potentially unreliable)
     *   byte stream
     * - the two sides exchange packets framed by 0x7e (SYNC_BYTE) bytes
     * - each packet has the form
     *     <packet type> <data bytes 1..n> <16-bit crc>
     *   where the crc (see net.tinyos.util.Crc) covers the packet type
     *   and bytes 1..n
     * - bytes can be escaped by preceding them with 0x7d and their
     *   value xored with 0x20; 0x7d and 0x7e bytes must be escaped, 
     *   0x00 - 0x1f and 0x80-0x9f may be optionally escaped
     * - There are currently 5 packet types:
     *   P_PACKET_NO_ACK: A user-packet, with no ack required
     *   P_PACKET_ACK: A user-packet with a prefix byte, ack required. 
     *     The receiver must send a P_ACK packet with the prefix byte
     *     as its contents.
     *   P_ACK: ack for a previous P_PACKET_ACK packet
     *   P_UNKNOWN: unknown packet type received. On reception of an
     *     unknown packet type, the receicer must send a P_UNKNOWN packet,
     *     the first byte must be the unknown packet type.
     * - Packets that are greater than a (private) MTU are silently dropped.
