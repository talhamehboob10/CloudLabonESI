This application is based loosely on the standard TOSBase app.

Via a well-defined packet structure, a user can send commands to a mote running
this application.  The mote will also forward packets from the radio to the
user over the uart.  Useful for testing motes in different ways.

To use the java tools included in the tools/java directly, you'll need tinyos
serial forwarders running for motes you wish to communicate with.  In turn,
this means you'll need to be running ibm's java sdk, and their javax.comm
stuff.  Both can be found (for linux, ia32) in ops:/proj/tbres/johnsond .

Finally: the java files in tools/java/net/emulab/packet/ are autogenerated from
mig ... but this way you don't have to generate them before using.

Yet to come: integrate an ad-hoc protocol as an option... and make it into a
component model.
