README for RobTransparetBase

Modified from the standard TransparentBase by ricci@cs.utah.edu

Forwards packets from the radio to the serial port, and vice versa. My
main modifications were: to use the GenericComm component for UART I/O
rather then Framer, to make it easier for my own scripts to process the
packets, and to stuff the received RSSI into packets that are resent on
the serial port.
