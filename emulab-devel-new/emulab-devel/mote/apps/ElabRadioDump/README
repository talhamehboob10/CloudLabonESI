README for ElabRadioDump

Modified from the standard TransparentBase by ricci@cs.utah.edu

Forwards packets from the radio to the serial port, and vice versa. My
main modifications were: to use the GenericComm component for UART I/O
rather then Framer, to make it easier for my own scripts to process the
packets, and to stuff the received RSSI into packets that are resent on
the serial port.

Actually, now it dumps sender, crc, AM type, and RSSI.  Tools for listening can
be built by a 'gmake -f Makefile.tools' ... the resulting binaries in
tools/src should include a C serial forwarder, sf listener, and a raw serial
listener.  Both listeners dump the same output.
