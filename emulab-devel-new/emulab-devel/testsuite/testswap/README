REQUIREMENTS
  ssh-agent running with SSH emulab keys added
  emulab client certificate and decrypted private key
  TBConfig.pm set up correctly
  ssh executable in path

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
   #this configures CPAN and installs CPAN dependencies in your homedir if you don't have root access to do it yourself
  ./install_deps_from_cpan

  #this installs CPAN dependencies into your system as root using CPAN as already configured
  sudo ./install_deps_from_cpan --install_deps
    
  When prompted:
      UUID state storage [/tmp] (HIT ENTER)
      default umask [0007] (HIT ENTER)
      Which SSL install path do you want to use? [/usr] (HIT ENTER)
      Do you want to run the live tests (y/N) ? [N] (HIT ENTER)

  add export PERL5LIB=~/lib/perl5 to your environment if you did a local cpan install to your homedir

  copy TBConfig.pm.in to TBConfig.pm and edit it to point to your emulab SSL client certificate and corresponding decrypted private key.

HOWTO create a cert file and a decrypted private key file from your emulab(cert+key) file.
  Generate a emulab certificate USING THE EMULAB WEB INTERFASE
  openssl rsa -in emulab -out decrypted_emulab.key
  openssl x509 -in emulab -out emulab.cert

TO SEE Tests available to run
  ./tbts 
 
TO RUN Tests
  ./tbts test
  ./tbts tests/topologies/single_node.pm
  ./tbts -D OS=RHL90-STD tests/ImageTests.pm
  ./tbts tests/OldTestSuiteTests.pm

EXAMPLE Tests to look at to GET STARTED:
  tests/topologies/single_node.pm
  tests/topologies/two_node_lan.pm
  tests/topologies/simple_two_node_linktest.pm
  tests/topologies/link_up_link_down.pm

Documentation can be found in the doc directory
running pod2text on any pm file will produce API docs.

Almost all test script functionality is provided by the following three files
pod2text lib/TestBed/XMLRPC/Client/Experiment.pm
pod2text lib/TestBed/TestSuite/Experiment.pm
pod2text lib/TestBed/TestSuite.pm

pod2text lib/Tools/TBSSH.pm provides lots of nice additions to ssh








#Deprecated more modern and perlish form of installation

Module Install is a comprehensive installer.
It will:
  download and install dependencies
  install tbts in the filesystem to a PREFIX if desired
  generate MAN pages for all the .pm files
  etc

Module::Install instructions  
  cpan needs to be configured and functional
  cpan Module::Install
  perl Makefile.PL
  make

Module::Install is a perl library for installing perl modules/frameworks like testswap
