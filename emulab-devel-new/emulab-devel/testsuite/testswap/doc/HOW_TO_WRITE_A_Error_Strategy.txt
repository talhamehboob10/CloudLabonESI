Error strategies allow for catching the following experiment errors
  TestBed::ParallelRunner::Executor::PrerunError
  TestBed::ParallelRunner::Executor::SwapinError
  TestBed::ParallelRunner::Executor::RunError
  TestBed::ParallelRunner::Executor::SwapoutError
  TestBed::ParallelRunner::Executor::KillError

Extend TestBed::ParallelRunner::ErrorStrategy

TestBed::ParallelRunner::BackoffStrategy is an example of how to do this.

BackoffStrategy->build takes a string of four arguments concatenated with ':'
  "waittime:maxretires:exponent:maxtime"

  waittime   is the time in seconds to wait between retries
  maxretries is the maximum number of retries to attempt before failing
  exponent   is the exponent to raise the waittime to i.e. (waittime * (2 ** exponent))
  maxtime    is the maximum total time to be spent attempting to retry

if maxtime elapses or maxretries attempts is reached the experiment is terminated.
