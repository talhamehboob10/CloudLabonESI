# test_lin_blend2.py - 9 point radial version.
# Quick prototype of piecewise triangular linear blending.
#
# The object is to apply error corrections from the center, edge-midpoints,
# and corners of a camera grid to the whole grid.
#
# To use this program, first make a file_dumper input file specifying the
# calibration data at the center, edge midpoints, and corner points in meters.
# The required order is left-to-right, bottom-to-top, so the lower-left corner
# comes first on the bottom row, then the middle and top rows.  Gather these
# points using file_dumper, and analyze them through dump_analyzer.
#
# Gather a finer grid of points to be corrected using file_dumper.  (If the
# corners and origin above are part of the fine grid, you can extract a subset
# of this file_dumper data and analyze it to make the above file.)
#
# Usage: test_lin_blend2.py [-t [-g]] [-d] ptAnal gridData
#
# Dash option flags:
#  -t - Output only gnuplot lines for the triangles.
#  -g - Output triangle lines in global world coordinates for composite plots.
#       The world_{x,y,theta} in the gridData file are applied.
#       Otherwise the "world" coords here are local to the camera.
#  -d - Enable debugging output.
#
# There are two filename args:
#
# ptAnal - The dump_analyzer output file for the center and corner points.
#          The order must be as above.  The section headers give the target
#          world coordinates in meters.  The mean_[ab][xy] give Mezzanine
#          fiducial blob coordinates in pixels, and the mean_[xy]_offset tells
#          the world coordinate error in meters (difference from the target)
#          to be canceled out at the center pixel between the fiducial blobs.
#
# gridData - The file_dumper output file containing data to be corrected.
#          Each data frame contains blob [ab] coordinates and world
#          coordinates.  The blob coordinates are passed through the error
#          correction blend, producing a world coordinate offset which is
#          added to the and new world coordinates in the data frame line,
#          which is then output.  Everything else streams straight through.
