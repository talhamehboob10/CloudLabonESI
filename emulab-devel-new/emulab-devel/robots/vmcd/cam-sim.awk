# cam-sim.awk - Simulate imaging of a floor grid into an overhead wide-angle camera.
# The default output is rows and then columns of grid points for gnuplot.
# An optional output simulates file_dumper grid points.
# A blank line separates the points along a row or column from the next one.
# 
# Option vars, set with -v var=arg:
#  -v floor=1 - Output floor coordinates for the grid in meters.
#  -v warp=1 - Apply a radial distortion to warp the ccd coords.  
#              Value is the warp factor, 1.0 is a simple cosine.
#  -v mm=1 - Output ccd coords in mm from the optical axis instead of in pixels.
#  -v pts=1 - Output just the grid points in row-major order.
#  -v fd=1 - file_dumper output, grid points in pixels plus world coords in meters.
#
# Commands:  shell			   gnuplot
#  cam-sim.awk -v floor=1 > grid.data	   plot "grid.data" with lines
#  cam-sim.awk > nowarp.data		   plot "nowarp.data" with lines

#  cam-sim.awk -v warp=1.414 > warp2.data  plot "warp2.data" with lines
