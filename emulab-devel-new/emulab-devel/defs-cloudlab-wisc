# This version has an entirely private address space; i.e., the servers

# The control network looks like:
#
# Complete:            10.1.32/22
# "public" segment:      10.1.33/24
# "private" segment:     10.1.32/24
# "node control segment: 10.1.34/23 (aka: 10.1.34/24, 10.1.35/24)
#
# This configuration requires a router/firewall between the segments
# and providing access to the outside. The router interface addresses
# for each segment are 10.1.{32,33,34}.1.
