Subject: over disk quota at @THISHOMEBASE@

Hello,

It looks like your disk usage has exceeded your disk quota. Please move or
remove some files to get below your quota. Disk space is limited, so if
you could clean up your directory it would be appreciated.

You can check your usage with the 'quota' command on @USERNODE@:

@USERNODE@> quota -v -l
`quota -v -l $i`

(Note: This will not work from nodes in an experiment.)

The directory trees (on @USERNODE@) where you most likely have files are:

$PROJSTR
$GROUPSSTR
$USERSSTR
$SCRATCHSTR

PLEASE NOTE: just login to @USERNODE@ directly to do the cleanup!
You will not be able to swapin an experiment to access these directories
while over quota.

$QUOTAHELP

Thanks,
@THISHOMEBASE@ Testbed Operations
@TBOPSEMAIL_NOSLASH@
