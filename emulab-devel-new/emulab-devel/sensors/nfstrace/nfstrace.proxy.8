.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B nfstrace.proxy
utility performs queries on the NFS tracing database.  The tool is broken up
into three sub-actions described below: gc, get, and stats.  The first two
actions setup tracing for a set of nodes and get the list of files and links
they have accessed.  The last action provides a print out of overall
statistics for NFS usage.
.P
The set of global options is as follows:
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help
Print the usage message for the
.B nfstrace.proxy
utility as a whole or, if an action is given, the usage message for that
action.
.TP
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version
Print out version information and exit.
.TP
\fB-m\fR, \fB--machine
Use an output style suitable for machine processing.  The default style is for
humans.
.SH ACTION: GC
The
.B gc
action is used to remove old state for a set of nodes and record their new
association.  The set of nodes is read from standard input with the format
"\fIvname\fR:\fIIP\fR".
.P
Required arguments:
.TP
.I pid
The project ID of the experiment the nodes are a member of.
.TP
.I eid
The experiment ID of the experiment the nodes are a member of.
.SH ACTION: GET
The
.B get
action retrieves the set of files accessed by the nodes in an experiment.  The
output is separated into two or three columns.  The first column specifies
whether the file was read and/or written or if it is a link.  The second column
is the size of the file at the last time it was accessed.  The last column is
the file name.
.P
Accessed files are those that have been read or written by a node and have not
been removed since the last access.  Accessed links are those that refer to a
file that has been accessed.
.P
Optional Arguments:
.TP
\fB-m\fR, \fB--mount\fR=\fIsdir\fR:\fIcdir
Add a mount mapping to use when translating links with absolute paths.  The
.I sdir
value represents the absolute path on the server and the
.I cdir
value represents the absolute path as mounted on the nodes.  Any links found to
start with
.I cdir
will have
.I sdir
substituted in its place.  This option can be used multiple times.
.\" XXX We should probably do the opposite thing here and translate all files
.\" starting with the mount sdir to start with cdir.
.SH ACTION: STATS
The
.B stats
action prints out information about the most active hosts using NFS and the
most actively accessed files.
.P
Optional Arguments:
.TP
\fB-c\fR, \fB--count\fR=\fInum
The maximum number of hosts/files to print for each statistic.
.SH DATABASE
.TP
nfsdb
The
.B mysql
database where NFS tracing information is stored.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.TP
0
If the action was completed successfully.
