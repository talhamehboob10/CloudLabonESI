## "Legacy" assign node flags - will be replaced with properties, and in some
## cases, explicit links
NodeFlagSpec =
    ## Gives the amount of bandwidth this node can forward through its loopback
    ## interface. In the future, we will make the loopback interface/link
    ## explicit in the topology
    ## Valid only for physical nodes
    (element trivial_bandwidth { xsd:integer })?,
    ## Specify that this node is a subnode of another node. We MIGHT
    ## try to do this with properties in the future
    ## Valid for both virtual and physical nodes
    element subnode_of { text }?,
    ## Indicates that this node should never be considered identical to any
    ## other node. Could be done with a property
    ## Valid only for physical nodes
    element unique { empty }?,
    ## Indicates that virtual links must either all be trivial (loopback), or
    ## none of them must be. Possibly expressible with properties?
    element disallow_trivial_mix { empty }?

## A node in the topology
NodeSpec = element node { NodeContents }
  
NodeContents =
    ## Name of the node - each node name must be unique within the 
    ## top element

    ## that it can be overriden in the virtual topology schema, where you are
    ## only allowed to have one

    ## The characteristics (bandwidth, latency, loss) which affect traffic.
        LinkCharacteristics,
    ## Type of this link - we use a named pattern here (defined below), so
    ## that it can be overriden in the virtual topology schema, where you are
    ## only allowed to have one
