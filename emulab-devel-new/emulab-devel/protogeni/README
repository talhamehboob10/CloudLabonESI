This directory contains an experimental implementation of ProtoGENI.
As of summer 2008, it is evolving rapidly.

From the GENI website:

"GENI, the Global Environment for Network Innovations, is a proposed
 national facility that supports exploration of radical designs for a
 future global networking infrastructure. It will be a research
 network/testbed that is geographically distributed, contains diverse
 devices including wireless, supports many simultaneous experimenters,
 and allows end-users to use and exploit those experimental protocols."

ProtoGENI is a smaller, less fancy, but functional version of both the
GENI software and deployed hardware. We are primarily deriving it from
our Emulab software, and secondarily leveraging the existing Planetlab
software. Both base systems are production code.
