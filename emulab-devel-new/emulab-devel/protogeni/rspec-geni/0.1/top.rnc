## Link types are currently just a siple string. They will almost certainly 
## have to get more complicated, for two reasons:
##     First, I want to allow virtual links to specify more than one type, so
##       that we can ask for links that are, say, 'ethernet or loopback'
##     Second, I want to have a lot more control over links that get mapped to
##       multi-hop paths

## independent. But they might become order-dependant later.
