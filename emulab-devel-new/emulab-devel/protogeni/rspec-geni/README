--------
Manifest
--------

There are four+ directories:

0.1, 0.2, 2, and 3 are all versions of the core rspec. These are all
stable versions and should only be changed if there is a
backwards-compatible bugfix.

In these directories, the *.rnc files are human-readable source and
*.xsd are generated schemas. The exception to the rule is the file
'2/any-extension-schema.xsd' which is a hand-made conversion of
'any-extension.rnc' because Trang imperfectly translates the rnc file.

The ext directory houses extensions meant for general
publication. Each extension is maintained by the institution described
in the MAINTENANCE file. You should only change an extension if it is
maintained by you or if you have the approval of the maintainer.

---------
rspeclint
---------

rspeclint is a standalone perl script which can be used to verify a
core schema and zero or more extension schemas against an XML
file. The command line to run it is:

./rspeclint [[<namespace> <schema>] ...] <document>

It will verify the XML document using the pairs of namespace, schema
to verify particular namespaces against schema paths or URLs against a
document. It will also use the schemaLocation tag inside of the XML
document to verify. If the command line namespace/schema pairs do not
match those in the schemaLocation tag, it will flag an error.

--------
Building
--------

To build the schemas, run

gmake all

This will create .xsd files from the .rnc files in the 0.1, 0.2, 2, etc
directories. To build the .xsd files, you will need to have Trang
installed. When running Make, the TRANG environment variable should be
set to the Java command line that should be used to execute TRANG.

The ad/request/manifest files can be removed with:

gmake clean
