flack.mxml
 - Main application, mostly bootstrapping and high-level stuff.

com.flack.shared.*
 - Code that isn't GENI-specific. The original purpose of this shared library was to extract classes which could be used in either the GENI or Emulab code.
 - Top-level classes help with some basic stuff like caching or bootstrapping. The FlackDispatcher is the main class which is responsible for throwing flack-related events.

com.flack.shared.display.*
 - Visual elements to represent tasks
 
com.flack.shared.display.areas.*
 - Base code for areas along with some basic implementations like the tasker and map areas.
 
com.flack.shared.display.components.*
 - Some basic components like buttons or editors.
 
com.flack.shared.display.panes.*
 - Just the task pane, to show currently running tasks.
 
com.flack.shared.display.skins.*
 - Skins, mostly used to make sure everything was big enough for touch interfaces. There are also some to improve behavior.
 
com.flack.shared.display.windows.*
 - Base code for pop-up windows.

com.flack.shared.logging.*
 - Base code for the logging mechanism used everywhere.

com.flack.shared.resources.*
 - Some basic objects used to represent managers, resource documents, components, sites, APIs, users, IDN-URNs, and identifiable objects.

com.flack.shared.tasks.*
 - Base code for the task engine.

com.flack.shared.tasks.file.*
 - Basic tasks to handle loading or saving files.

com.flack.shared.tasks.http.*
 - Base tasks for HTTP tasks (through the browser or Forge).

com.flack.shared.tasks.xmlrpc.*
 - Base task for XML-RPC calls.

com.flack.shared.utils.*
 - Basic utility files that provide helpers for math, strings, etc.

com.flack.emulab.*
 - You can ignore this, it's basically the code I got working to make flack talk with Emulab's XML-RPC interface.

com.flack.geni.*
 - All of the Flack code specific to the GENI world.
 - GeniUniverse (instantiated at GeniMain.geniUniverse) basically holds all GENI information (user, aggregates, authorities)
 - GeniCache uses SharedCache to save/load GENI-specific stuff which should persist.

com.geni.display.*
 - GUI code (areas, mapping, panes, slice, windows, etc.).  Basically if you use Flack and you can see it, the class will be in here and may extend basic classes in com.shared.display.*.

com.geni.plugins.*
 - Gemini, Instools, ShadowNet, etc.
 - Sliver types are defined here.  The Emulab plugin defines the sliver types found at Emulab, PlanetLab defines sliver types found there, etc. This allows Flack to control behavior based on the sliver type.
 - Each plugin can also have an area which is available in the slice editor but it isn't required.
 - Plugins like Instools listen for events like when a slice has been completely parsed (all manifests recieved) and perform actions like determining whether instools was used or not.

com.geni.resources.*
 - Data structures used to represent the GENI universe

com.geni.resources.docs.*
 - Credentials

com.geni.resources.physical.*
 - Advertised resources (nodes, links, interfaces).

com.geni.resources.sites.*
 - Representations for aggregate managers, slice authorities, and clearinghouse.  The managers package also includes helper classes for determining what certain link types or sliver types are able to do.

com.geni.resources.virt.*
 - Resources that are (or will be) sliced.  This includes everything from stitching, slivers, aggregate slivers, slices, nodes, links, etc.  If it isn't advertised but needs to be used when working with slices, it's here.

com.geni.tasks.*
 - Tasks that need to be done (parsing rspecs, submitting slices, etc.)

com.geni.tasks.groups.*
 - Tasks which are multi-step (creating slices, listing resources, etc.)

com.geni.tasks.groups.slice.*
 - Multi-step tasks for slices (deleting, creating, submitting, getting, etc.)

com.geni.tasks.http.*
 - Basic HTTP tasks to use the public lists for authorities and maangers.

com.geni.tasks.process.*
 - Generate and parse RSPECs.

com.geni.tasks.tests.*
 - Tests that have probably all bit-rot which were used to test the initial version of the task engine, event engine, GUI, and some specific scenarios.

com.geni.tasks.xmlrpc.am.*
 - AM API tasks

com.geni.tasks.xmlrpc.protogeni.*
 - ProtoGENI API tasks

com.geni.tasks.xmlrpc.scs.*
 - SCS (stitching) tasks
