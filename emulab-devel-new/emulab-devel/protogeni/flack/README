Flack3

Development
===========
FlashBuilder is not required, but recommended.  Below are directions for using either Adobe's commercial IDE FlashBuilder or the freely available FLEX SDK commandline tools.

Flash Builder
------------
Version: 4.7+ (support for Apache Flex was added in that version)
SDK: >= Apache Flex 4.9 (copy to the flash builder's SDK folder and add to the installed SDKs in the Flash Builder section of preferences)

The version of Flash Builder doesn't really matter, just make sure it has the minimum required version of the Apache Flex SDK installed.

You should be able to copy the flack directory into a FlashBuilder workspace and import it as a project.

Ensure:
- In the run configurations, make sure it launches 'js\flack.html' instead of the default .swf
- In the project preferences: under 'Flex Compiler':
 * >= 4.9 SDK is selected
 * 'generate HTML wrapper' is unselected
- In the project preferences: under 'Flex Build Path':
 * Output directory is 'js'
 * Framework linkage is 'merged into code'

Apache FLEX SDK only
-------------
You should be able to use the included build.xml with the freely available Flex SDK >= 4.9 to generate a flack.swf which you can copy into the js/ directory and run the flack.html.
