This directory contains diffs for a clean FreeBSD 6.2 RELEASE tree.
These diffs, for the lib/libstand and sys/boot source directories,
are necessary to build the "pxeboot" first-stage boot loader used on
Emulab nodes.

libstand.diffs:

  These are primarily robustness changes for the standalone TFTP code.
  There is also a bug fix or two, and a patch to have bootp/dhcp recognize
  and respect the TFTP server name option (66).  To apply this patch:

	(cd <yoursrcdir>; patch -p2) < libstand.diffs

  Install the new version of the library with:

	cd <yoursrcdir>/lib/libstand
	make
	make install

  These changes are compatible with, and should not effect, any other
  boot programs.


sysboot.diffs:

  Primarily this patch adds a subdirectory (sys/boot/i386/emuboot) for
  the PXE-loaded first-stage boot loader we use.

  Most of the other diffs are in support of this loader (typically
  conditionally compiled/assembled via the 'TESTBED' symbol).  There
  are new options in sys/boot/i386/Makefile.inc for forcing the serial
  console, or changing its speed or port number, make sure these are
  correct for your site.

  There is also a directory (sys/boot/i386/emuboot0) which is a slightly
  modified version of boot0 (the MBR-resident boot loader) that just
  reboots the machine unless explicitly told what to do after a short time.
  This is a fall-back in case PXE booting fails (due to a transient load
  on the network) and the BIOS falls back to booting from disk.  This will
  force the machine to keep rebooting and retrying PXE until it works.
  Apply this patch with:

	(cd <yoursrcdir>; patch -p2) < sysboot.diffs

  Then modify the i386/Makefile.inc file as appropriate and build with:

	cd <yoursrcdir>/sys/boot
	make

  DON'T DO AN INSTALL HERE.  I am less certain that these changes are
  compatible with all existing boot code.  Instead:

	cp -p /tftpboot/pxeboot.emu /tftpboot/pxeboot.emu.bak
	cp <yoursrcdir>/sys/boot/i386/emuboot/pxeboot /tftpboot/pxeboot.emu
