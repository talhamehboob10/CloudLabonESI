# Emulab sudoers file. Serves double duty:
#
#  * Allows members of the wheel group to sudo without a password
#
#  * Replaces "suidperl" allowing any user to run a script in the
#    /usr/testbed/suidbin directory as root.
#
# For the latter, we clamp down on the environment of the user.
# suidperl just changed the effective uid to root and left all groups
# and the environment the same. We clean out the environment, including
# setting a default path.
#
# XXX we do not actually use this config right now since preserve_groups
# loses the primary group in the resulting group list. Emulab needs all
# the groups to be unchanged.
