I have had enormous grief doing routine "pkg upgrade -r Emulab" because of the
alternate ipmitool package required for Moonshot chassis.

If you upgrade emulab-boss, it will want to install the regular ipmitool
package over the top of emulab-ipmitool-old whether or not the old package is
locked. This is because the standard ipmitool packages knows nothing about
the hack package. I guess I really need an alternate emulab-boss-moonshot
package that depends on emulab-ipmitool-old instead to deal with this,
but in the meantime you can work around it with a little disruption.

If you have the old tool installed, remove it:

    sudo pkg delete -f emulab-ipmitool-old

Now go ahead and do the upgrade:

    sudo pkg upgrade -r Emulab emulab-boss

This will install the standard ipmitool and leave you briefly in a state
where you cannot manipulate the Moonshot nodes. Then force a deinstall of
just ipmitool:

    sudo pkg delete -f ipmitool

Now reinstall the hack ipmitool USING THE PACKAGE FILE. You will need to scp
over the package (e.g., from ops.emulab.net:/share/freebsd/11.3/packages)
first of course:

    sudo pkg add -M emulab-ipmitool-old-1.8.15_1.txz

If you do not use -M it will want to deinstall the emulab-boss package.
Finally, you modify the local package DB to reflect the correct dependency:

    sudo pkg set -n ipmitool:emulab-ipmitool-old

Now all future incremental upgrades should work with no hacks. However, once
the emulab-boss package has to be updated, you will have to do this all again.
