The ABAC project has designed and implemented tools for using
Attribute-Based Access Control, a scalable authorization system based
on formal logic.  It maps principals to attributes and uses the
attribute to make an authorization decision, e.g., if user1 has the
login attribute the login program will alllow them to log in.  This
library, libabac, is a base on which to build those tools.  It is in
use in the DETER federation system and being integrated with the GENI
network testbed.
