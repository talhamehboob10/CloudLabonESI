*** Create an mfsroot directory tree from the CD:

So, follow the steps to create another copy of the fixit CD on hardisk.
The cut it way back so that it fits in a 64 MB filesystem. This is not as
hard as it seems. See the FILES file in this directory for a dump of the
top level directories, which should give you a good idea of what to cut
back. Note that you do not need any .a libs or any _p (profile) libs!
You do not the compat libs either.

Note that you cannot use this mfsroot on the CDROM cause it has to fit into
a 2.8MB floopy boot image. Its good for booting via PXE or for putting in
/boot on your disk.

Copy in fstab and rc.conf from this directory to /etc of your new directory
tree. Edit the rc.conf to make sure the DHCP interfaces are correct.

You also want to give it a root password. You can do that by using the -d
option to vipw:

	vipw -d /FOO/etc

Create the ssh host keys in /FOO/etc/ssh:

	/usr/bin/ssh-keygen -N "" -f /FOO/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
	/usr/bin/ssh-keygen -d -N "" -f /FOO/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key

Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config to allow root login:

	PermitRootLogin yes

Make sure you have a termcap file in /etc:

	rm -f /FOO/etc/termcap
	cp /etc/termcap /FOO/etc/termcap

Edit /FOO/etc/ttys and turn on the serial console:

	console "/usr/libexec/getty std.115200" unknown on secure

Create /FOO/usr/site/bin and stash useful (required) stuff in it:

	-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  205084 Jun 26 06:15 hier*
	-rwxrwxr-x  1 root  wheel   90952 Jun 26 12:25 imageunzip*
	-rwxrwxr-x  1 root  wheel  129174 Jun 26 10:49 imagezip*
	-r-xr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  124532 Jun 26 10:48 wget*

Create /FOO/usr/local/lib and copy in libintl.so.2, which is needed
by wget, unless you go and reconfig it to statically link.


*** Create the image file.

	dd if=/dev/zero of=mfsroot bs=64k count=1024
	vnconfig -e -s labels vn0 mfsroot
	disklabel -r -w vn0 auto
	newfs /dev/vn0c
	mkdir -p /mnt/mfs 
	mount /dev/vn0c /mnt/mfs
	su1 hier cp /FOO /mnt/mfs
	umount /mnt/mfs
	vnconfig -u vn0
	cat mfsroot | gzip > mfsroot.gz

Copy this file and a kernel to /boot, or to the tftp boot directory.  Its
pretty big though, and perhaps not the best for PXE booting, but it will
work.
