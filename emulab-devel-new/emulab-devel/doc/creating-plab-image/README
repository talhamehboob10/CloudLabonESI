How to get from FC2-* to PLAB-* (v3.2)

1) Compiling the kernel

  Either copy the PlanetLab kernel source in "/share/plab/v3.2/src" to
  /usr/src or checkout a new copy via cvs, or get the source from the
  PlanetLab site.

  Find a matching config file for the kernel source in this directory
  and copy it to ".config". and do a "make oldconfig".  If an exact
  match is not found copy the PlanetLab config in the "configs/" and
  adjust it so the following drivers are compiled in.

    CONFIG_SCSI=y
    CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD=y
    CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_PROMISE=y
    CONFIG_SCSI_QLA2XXX=y
    CONFIG_FUSION=y

  Applying the most recent patch to config may do the trick.
  
  Edit the Makefile and change the minor version from "..-planetlab"
  to something else to distinguish it from the official PlanetLab
  kernel, I have been using "...-plab-NUM".

  Now make as normal
    make
    make modules_install
    make install
  Than manually adjust /etc/lilo.conf if necessary and rerun lilo

2) Add */sbin to the default path.  This step is not strictly needed
   but it makes things slightly more convenient, especially since 
   "/sbin:/usr/sbin" needs to be in the path for "vuseradd".

   To do so apply the patches found in etc-patches for /etc/profile
   and /etc/csh.login.

3) Install DevBox.

   Basically follow the instructions in:

     https://wiki.planet-lab.org/twiki/bin/view/Planetlab/DevBox

   However, note two things

   1) You probably do not want to install the kernel.  Thus when prompted
      to install the packages say no and manually install those that would
      of been installed minus the kernel.

   2) As of Feb 10, 2006, using the production DevBox installation,
      you will also need to install the package:
        util-vserver-legacy

   Also note that parts of resman doesn't seam to function correctly
   as it is looking for functionally of the kernel that no longer
   exists: memlimit seams to work, cpulimit and bwlimit abort,
   disklimit doesn't seam to have any effect.
