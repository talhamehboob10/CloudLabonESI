##### Setting up the Utah Network Testbed software
##### Most recently tested on FreeBSD 6.2 .
#####

##### Step 1 - OS installation and setup

Install FreeBSD on the machine you'll be using for your ops node, using the
standard FreeBSD installation process.  When asked by the installer, it's best
to choose the 'Developer' distribution set - this gets you full sources. When
it asks if you want to install the ports collection, answer *no*.  Do not
install any packages at this time - you'll get a chance to later.  You'll
need to partition your filesystems so that you have the proper amount of
space for certain directories - see below for details.

Make sure that you have the network correctly configured.

The following directories will need to exist on partitions that have enough
space to hold them:

/usr	      - Needs space for the ports tree and a system object tree.
	                At least 10GB. Be sure to build with plenty of
			inodes (the ports tree itself uses about 200000, so
			be safe and build with at least a million).
/usr/testbed/ - Needs space for testbed software and logs. Several (3-4) GB
			should be enough.

Do *not* create any user accounts yet, and just log in as root for the time
being.  Our software will create user accounts later, once you get boss set
up.

If you already created any users, then delete them with the "pw" command
and make sure the home directories for them are removed as well! 


##### Step 1a - Shared filesystem setup for combined ops/fs machine.

If you have a separate 'fs' node, you should have already setup your shared
filesystems and can skip to Step 2.  If this node is also to be your file
server, you will also need:

/users/       - Needs space for user home directories. Amount of space
			required depends on how many users you expect to have.
			Generally, though, we suggest that users store large
			files related to their projects in the /proj directory.
/proj/        - Needs space for project files. We recommend that this be larger
			than /users, to encourage people to store files here,
			which aids per-project accountability.
/groups/      - Needs enough space for files shared by the sub-groups of
			projects. These are primarily used by classes, if any.
/scratch/     - Optional, large filesystem of "scratch" space.  The intent
			is that this filesystem provides per-project space
			that is not "guaranteed" (for the Utah Emulab that
			means we do not back it up to tape).  If used,
			you would either set no quotas, or higher quotas
			than for /proj.  Most sites probably won't want this.
/share/       - Exported read-only to all nodes, we use it for providing to
			experimenters the source for the FreeBSD and Linux
			versions we run as well as common packages and RPMs.
			This could require anything from 1GB to 20GB+ depending
			on what you want to make available.
			
You may want to enforce quotas on the user-writable filesystems. This is the
main reason you'd want to keep them in separate filesystems (i.e., so people
can have different /users/ and /proj/ quotas.) If you do not think you will
ever use quotas, then you could make /users and /proj part of the same
filesystem.

As mentioned /scratch is optional.  If you are not providing "guarantees"
such as filesaved or RAIDed disk space and you are not using quotas, you
might as well just put all your space in /proj and not define FSDIR_SCRATCH
in the defs file.

Note also since /share is exported read-only, FreeBSD requires that it be on
a separate filesystem from anything that is exported read-write.  So while
/users, /proj and /groups can be on the same filesystem, /share cannot.

Make sure that, no matter how you decide to partition things up, you make
symlinks to the appropriate places. ie., if you make one big filesystem called
/z that has /users, /proj, and /groups in it, make sure you:

	ln -s /z/users /users
	ln -s /z/proj /proj
	... etc.

In other words, we assume the existence of /users, /proj, /group and /share
(but not /scratch).

##### Step 2 - Installing packages

To make sure that you're running with versions of software from the ports
collection that are known to work with our software, and to save you hours
of compile time, we provide pre-built binary packages of the ports required
by Emulab. 

If this is a new Emulab installation, or you do not need to maintain backward
compatibility with old OS images (i.e., you plan to build new ones) then
download the packages tarball from:

	http://www.emulab.net/downloads/FreeBSD-6.1-20080610.tar.gz

(You can use the FreeBSD 'fetch' command to download the file.)

If you are upgrading an existing installation, and you want to continue to
use your current OS images, then you need to download a different tarball:

	http://www.emulab.net/downloads/FreeBSD-6.1-20080610-elvincompat.tar.gz

Now, untar this someplace (you need about 140MB of space, so don't use /tmp).
Let's say you untarred it into /usr/tmp. You would then run:

	env PKG_PATH=/usr/tmp/packages pkg_add emulab-ops-2.0

Of course, if you untarred it somewhere else, put in the correct path.

We provide all of the binary packages necessary to build ops/fs/boss in our
packages tarball, making setup of an Emulab-in-Emulab very quick.  You may
want to install more packages built from ports tree makefiles with downloaded
sources, but if not there is no need to install a /usr/ports tree.

We have run into many, many problems with clashes between versions of the
FreeBSD ports.  So, rather than using the /usr/ports tree that comes on the
FreeBSD installation media, we use one that we've tested against. You can
grab our 'approved' copy of the ports tree from:

	http://www.emulab.net/downloads/ports-20060921.tar.gz
	
The tarball is about 40 meg; it unpacks to 175 meg.

Untar it, move it into place as /usr/ports (rename the old directory to
ports.old, or just remove it), and install whatever ports you want to make
ops feel like 'home' (like emacs, jove, or whatever)

##### Step 3 - Unpacking and running configure

At this point, you'll need to make a 'defs' file - You will use the same
defs file on boss, ops and fs. See defs-example in the top level directory
as a starting point. You want to make sure each of the variables has a
definition that makes sense in your environment. Feel free to ask Utah if
something is not clear.

Unpack the testbed source, and run it's configure script. A good place to
unpack the source code is /usr/testbed/src/testbed. You will use the
--with-TBDEFS option to configure to give it the path to your defs file:

	mkdir -p /usr/testbed/src/testbed
	mkdir -p /usr/testbed/obj/testbed
	cd /usr/testbed/src/testbed
	tar ....
	cd /usr/testbed/obj/testbed
	/usr/testbed/src/testbed/configure \
		--with-TBDEFS=/path/to/your/defs-file

Typically, you would store your defs file in the source tree along with 
the other defs files that came in the tarball.

##### Step 4 - Running the ops installation script

In the object tree you've configured (say, /usr/testbed/obj/testbed), there's
an 'install' subdirectory, with a script called 'ops-install'. Just run this
script as root (note the same package directory argument as above).

	cd install
	perl ops-install -p /usr/tmp/packages

It will take care of installing any additional ports, and doing various
other configuration of FreeBSD required to make it into an ops node. The
script is designed so that you can run it as many times as you want, and
it'll just skip stuff it's already done. If it fails, send the output to
Utah so that we can fix it up. If it succeeds, follow any other
instructions it may have. The script will tell you to reboot the machine,
but you can wait until after you do the next step to do so, if you want.

(You may have to set the executable bit on this script, since configure won't;
we'd like to get this fixed at some point.)

You should be aware that, among other things, this script sets up sendmail, and
sets up password-less 'sudo' for anyone in the 'wheel' group. If you don't want
these for security reasons, you can undo them after the installation script is
finished.

##### Step 5 - Installing from source

To install the actual testbed software, simply do a 'gmake ops-install' in your
object directory.

(Note: If you're logged in as root, /usr/local/bin, where gmake lives on
FreeBSD, may not be in your path.)

If you'll be using Cyclades or similar boards to use 'ops' as a serial console
server, you'll also want to do a 'gmake tipserv-install' in the object
directory. In addition, you'll need to build a custom kernel with the
appropriate driver (you may even need to get patches from Utah for some
boards). You'll also need to set up a few things (not yet automated),
described in doc/adding_nodes.txt .

##### Step 6 - Setting up mailing lists

Optional. The ops-install script set up some mailing lists for the email
addresses you set up in the defs file, in /etc/mail/lists . If you want to run
these mailing lists off your ops node, you can put some people in them now.
These are just standard sendmail list files: a list of addresses and/or
archive files, one per line. If you chose to use archive files, give a path
to the file you'd like sendmail to stick all correspondence in, and create
this file.

##### Step 7 - Other miscellaneous things to set up

  [Nothing at this time]

Once you're done with all of this, reboot ops.
