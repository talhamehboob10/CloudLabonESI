These are the steps we followed to create a second tip server:

1. Load the new 4.3 image, and then neuter the tmcd/tmcc stuff. Give
   it a fixed IP address (turn off DHCP).

2. Put in testbed /etc/group file (since we are going to run
   console_setup.proxy from paper), but a tbadmins only password file
   since mere users will not be able to log in.

3. Mount fs.emulab.net:/users on /users (in /etc/fstab).

4. Create new filesystem for /usr/testbed and mount it (in /etc/fstab). 

5. Install testbed software using new "gmake tipserv-install" target.

6. Edit /etc/rc.local to start up the /usr/site/etc/capture.rc file.

7. Create /usr/site/etc/capture.rc.

8. Symlink /var/log/tiplogs to /usr/testbed/log/tiplogs.

9. Edit /etc/syslog.conf:

	!capture
	*.*                             /usr/testbed/log/capture.log

   Must "touch" the log file so it exists.

10. Create /dev entries for cyclades with MAKEDEV.cz.

11. Edit /etc/remote as needed.

12. Edit /usr/site/etc/capture.rc as needed.

13. Make sure DB tiplines table reflects the node names/locations.
    Should be entries like:

	INSERT INTO tiplines VALUES ('pc109','tipserv1.emulab.net',0,0,'');

14. Create symlinks on plastic to NFS mounted directories on the
    tipserver. eg:

	plastic:/dev/tip/pc109.acl -->
			/nfs/tipserv1/dev/tip/pc109.acl
	plastic:/var/log/tiplogs/pc109.run -->
			/nfs/tipserv1/var/log/tiplogs/pc109.run
	plastic:/var/log/tiplogs/pc109.log -->
			/nfs/tipserv1/var/log/tiplogs/pc109.log

    Use amd on plastic for this since we don't hard mount cross deps.
