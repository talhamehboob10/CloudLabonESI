1. DESCRIPTION:

These are the files/directories needed for PXE booting.

README
	This file

freebsd*/
	kernel/MFS for a PXE-booted memory based FreeBSD 4.7 or 6.2 system.
	We use this MFS for creating disk images and general maintenance
	tasks on a node (e.g., when the node's disk is scrogged).
	The MFS contains a pretty small set of utilities.

frisbee*/
	kernel/MFS for a PXE-booted memory based FreeBSD 4.7 or 6.2 system.
	This MFS is considerably smaller than the "freebsd" one.
	It is used to reload node disks with frisbee.  Since it may be loaded
	simultaneously by many nodes to reload their disks, we wanted
	this to be as small as possible.  Not intended as an interactive
	environment, its rc.local script invokes frisbee and then reboots.

freebsd.newnode*/
	kernel/MFS for a PXE-booted memory based FreeBSD 4.7 or 6.2 system.
	A specialized version of the freebsd MFS for loading on nodes
	which are not yet part of Emulab.  Has a generic kernel and specialized
	scripts for figuring out the network connections, etc.

pxeboot*/pxeboot.emu-{sio,vga,null}
	This is a specialized version of the FreeBSD boot loader.
	There is a version for use with the 4.7 based system (pxeboot47)
	and one for the FreeBSD 6.2 system (pxeboot62).  In each of these
	directories, there are three versions of the boot loader:
	serial-line (-sio), VGA (-vga), and null (-null) console versions
	of our standard PXE-booted startup.  Whichever you choose should
	be renamed as /tftpboot/pxeboot.emu (or whatever your boss dhcpd.conf
	file says).


3. INSTALLATION:

If you are reading this file, then I guess you have succeeded in unpacking
the tarball.  Hopefully, you have unpacked it into /tftpboot.  If not, go
do that now, I'll wait...

...ok.  First, you have to choose between using FreeBSD 4.7 or FreeBSD 6.2
MFSes.  You almost certainly want to use the 6.2 versions since 6.2 supports
more hardware.  In fact, the "6.2 version" actually has a 6.3-STABLE kernel
built on 6/26/2008, so it is the lastest available for the 6.x series.

If you have any problem with the 6.2 versions *and* you have older hardware,
then try the 4.7 versions.  If the 6.2 version don't work because it appears
that your hardware is not supported, then contact Utah for more help.
In summary, I recommend:

	pxeboot62/pxeboot.emu-{sio,vga} (pick one and rename to "pxeboot.emu",
                                     then copy it to /tftpboot)
	frisbee62 (rename to "frisbee")
	freebsd62 (rename to "freebsd")
	freebsd62.newnode (rename to "freebsd.newnode")

Anyway, after choosing your MFSes, you should have three generic MFSes
(frisbee, freebsd, freebsd.newnode).  The three MFSes unloaded are "generic"
in the sense that they don't have any of your (or our) Emulab keys or
passwords.  That is ok for the "newnode" MFS, but the other two will need
to be customized for your site.  You will also need to run the 'prepare'
script for *each* of the three MFSes. See the README file in each boot
subdirectory for MFS-specific customization and installation instructions.

If you don't have VGA or serial lines, and it appears that nodes are not
booting, try using pxeboot.emu-null which gives you a non-interactive version
of the boot loader.  Some sites have had problems with "phantom" serial line
input from a non-existent serial line causing the -sio version of the boot
loader to drop into interactive mode.  Make sure you replace the loader.conf
file in the three subdirectories with the -null version as well.

4. EMULAB INTEGRATION

For Emulab to know about the MFSes you have just installed, you will need
to add some database state.  This is done using the "load-descriptors"
script in your Emulab build tree:

       cd <your-elab-build-dir>/install
       ./load-descriptors <your-elab-source-dir>/install/<descriptor-file>

<descriptor-file> is either "descriptors.sql" or "descriptors-new.sql"
depending on whether you are going to load FreeBSD4+Redhat9 or
FreeBSD6+Fedora6 as your standard image on disks.  Sorry, but this is a
bit of a forward reference, since determining which of those you want
means skipping ahead and looking at:

      http://www.emulab.net/downloads/generic-image-README.txt

which is part of customizing a disk image for your nodes.  Look at part II
of that file ("Which generic image do I need?").  If you choose FBSD62+FC6,
then use "descriptors-new.sql", otherwise use "descriptors.sql".
(In the next release, we will separate the DB state for the MFS images from
that of the disk images, and get rid of this confusing step...)
