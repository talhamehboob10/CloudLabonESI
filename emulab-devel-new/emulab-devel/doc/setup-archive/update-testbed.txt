Rough steps for upgrading your existing Emulab.

0. "Shutdown" the testbed.  Disable the web interface and prevent user
   logins to "users":

	boss> wap webcontrol -l nologin

   We also want to make sure that none of the testbed daemons are
   running:

	boss> sudo mv -f /usr/local/etc/rc.d/3.testbed.sh \
                         /usr/local/etc/rc.d/3.testbed.sh.save

   Add add this to /etc/rc.conf to prevent the cron based daemons from
   running:

	cron_enable="NO"

   Then reboot boss.

1. Look at doc/UPDATING to find out what you have to update in the
   boss/ops FreeBSD environment before updating Emulab software.
   Entries are timestamped, so look for things that have changed since
   the last you installed.

2. Unpack and build the Emulab software.  You should do this in a directory
   accessible to your boss and ops machines (and your fs and tipserv machines
   if you have them) to make the various installs easier.  Typically this
   would be a directory in /users or /proj.

3. BACKUP YOUR DB on boss.  Do:
	mysqldump tbdb > db.backup

4. Update the DB on boss.  Look at sql/database-migrate.txt which is a list
   of SQL commands to perform. In some cases, it also includes instructions
   regarding operations you need to perform on your data to make it work
   in the new schema.  Diff the version of this file from the last release,
   with the version from this release to find which ones to apply.

   If all goes well, install the newly built emulab software:

	boss> gmake boss-install
	boss> cd rc.d; gmake install
	
   Be aware that the "boss-install" make target will do further checks
   for missing rows in DB tables.  That target will fail, and tell you
   what to do to fix your DB, in that case.  It does the table check
   in two pieces, so it is possible you will have to fix the DB, and
   restart the boss-install twice.

   If anything goes wrong with the DB update step, contact us.  You can
   still abort the upgrade at this point by putting back the old db:
       mysql
       drop database tbdb;
       create database tbdb;
       quit
       mysql < db.backup
   and bringing the testbed back up.  After this step, you are committed
   to the upgrade.

5. If you have one or more "tipserv" machines, login to them, cd to your
   build directory and do:
       sudo gmake tipserv-install

6. If you have a combined ops/fs machine (the common case), skip to step 7.
   Otherwise:
   a. login to "fs", cd to your build directory and do:
       sudo gmake fs-install
   b. login to "ops" ("users"), cd to your build directory and do:
       sudo gmake ops-install
       cd rc.d; sudo gmake control-install
   Skip to step 8.

7. Login to your "ops" (aka "users") machine, cd to your build directory
   and do:
       sudo gmake opsfs-install

9. Install a "shared" copyright to appear on the web pages.  We have not
   yet integrated this step, so it is a little awkward:

   Edit www/copyright-contrib.html and fill in values for @SITENAME@,
   @SITEDATES@, @SITECOPYRIGHT@.  Then copy this file to copyright.html
   in your installed testbed tree, e.g.:
       cp copyright-contrib.html /usr/testbed/www/copyright.html

10. Undo the changes in Step 1.

	boss> wap webcontrol -l login
	boss> sudo rm -f /usr/local/etc/rc.d/3.testbed.sh.save

    And remove the cron disable line from /etc/rc.conf

11.Reboot tipservers, ops and boss and make sure things boot up ok.
   Try creating/swapping/modifying/destroying an experiment, look
   for errors.

12.Bring up the web interface and inform users that they should reboot
   their existing experiment nodes if they notice odd behaviors.

Things should be backward compatible so you don't have to update the
standard disk images immediately.  But you will want to do it.  See
update-node.txt for more info about that.
