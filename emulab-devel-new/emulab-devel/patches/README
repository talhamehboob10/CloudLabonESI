Patches we apply to various parts of FreeBSD and its ports.
Not all are relevant any more.

I. Relevant:

A. FreeBSD-10.3-autofs.patch

   Backported patch from FreeBSD 11 to make autofs handle long directory
   entry names. Useful if you use autofs rather than amd to mount user/proj
   directories on bss.

     cd /usr/src
     sudo patch -p0 < patchfile

B. FreeBSD-10.3-ixl.patch

   Version from FreeBSD 10-stable with fixes not present in 10-release.
   Addressed some hang and panic issues with multiple 10Gb interfaces.
   Only needed if you have Intel 10Gb interfaces!

     cd /usr/src
     sudo patch -p0 < patchfile

C. FreeBSD-10.3-mountd.patch

   Utah changes to speed up mountd updates in the presence of 2000+ entries
   in the exports file. This includes doing incremental updates to the kernel
   export info (as opposed to completely removing the info and then putting
   it all in again), caching of "--maproot=root" credentials, and some stats
   collection and reporting. N.B. I have only ever tested these changes with
   NFSv3 and I doubt very much they will work with v4! 

     cd /usr/src/usr.sbin
     sudo patch -p0 < patchfile

D. FreeBSD-10.3-pw-2.patch

   Incorporate some 10-STABLE speed-ups of temp files and a Utah change
   to pw_user to not make so many group file writes. You would really
   only notice these changes if you have > ~500 groups and users that are
   in 100+ of those groups.

     cd /usr/src
     sudo patch -p0 < patchfile

E. FreeBSD-10.x-vfs_exports.patch

   Backported fix from FreeBSD 11 to avoid a nasty kernel memory leak in
   the filesystem export code. Probably only a problem if you have lots
   (1000+) of exported filesystems and lots of node churn.

     cd /usr/src
     sudo patch -p0 < patchfile

F. FreeBSD-10.3-ipod.patch

   Utah kernel modification to allow an authenticated ICMP "Ping Of Death"
   ("ipod") packet. (Yes, we came before that other ipod...) We only define
   this on node kernels and not on the servers.

     cd /usr/src
     sudo patch -p0 < patchfile
