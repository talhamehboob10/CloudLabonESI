# This version has an entirely private address space; i.e., the servers
# and nodes cannot be accessed directly from the Internet.
# The control network looks like:
#
# Complete:            10.1.32/22
# "public" segment:      10.1.33/24
# "private" segment:     10.1.32/24
# "node control segment: 10.1.34/23 (aka: 10.1.34/24, 10.1.35/24)
#
# This configuration requires a router/firewall between the segments
# and providing access to the outside. The router interface addresses
# for each segment are 10.1.{32,33,34}.1.
#
# Use the --with-TBDEFS=filename to specify your own file.

#  * The -S (suspend) option to mountd, integrated into 10.x (and 9.x
#    as of 11/2012), is a workaround that allows suspension of the NFS
#    server while the exports are changed.
#
#  * The new nfse (http://nfse.sourceforge.net/) atomic exports framework
#    for FreeBSD 10.
