Add functions to switch link color policy, so all links can easily be
set to a single color or to inherit the color of their parent. Bump
version number to 1.1.2.

Fix bug with the addNode/addLink routines (used when loading graphs
from memory instead of disk file). Bump version number to 1.1.1.

Add Linux Makefiles, bump version number to 1.1, update documentation
accordingly.

Repack up the distribution, somehow Makefile.* files got left out

Go back to the NAMESPACEHACK approach of using preprocessor defines
since apparently some compilers aren't happy with "using namespace
std;"

Add a bit more Makefile documentation, etc.

Convert the Release include file pathname from absolute to relative in
the Windoze VisualC++ settings.

currently tested: Irix Xt, Irix GLUT, Windows VisualC++ (OpenGL)
conjectured to work: FreeBSD Xt Mesa, Irix ViewKit

more Makefile munging.

Groups are all now enabled by default. The previous policy of forcing
explicit enabling was a major source of bugs in application programs.
Now the application programmer can explicitly turn them off at will,
but no action means that everything is drawn.

Fixed layout bugs which were exposed by certain data sets. Minor startup 
optimizations. 

Ported to Windows VisualC++.

This code has been modified by Daniel W. McRobb at CAIDA
(dwm@caida.org).  The Ok* classes are gone, replaced by STL and standard
C++ classes (array types replaced by STL <vector>, OkStr replaced by
<string>).  This eliminated the troublesome large macros, and made thing
much easier to port to a GNU environment.  Currently the glut interface
works on Solaris 2.7.  The rest will be fixed and tested soon, except
ViewKit (since I don't have ViewKit anywhere).  Near-term porting target
are FreeBSD 3.0 and Linux using X/OGL from Xi Graphics (see
http://www.xig.com/) and Linux using Mesa/GLIDE.  In all likelihood,
plain old Mesa (no hardware accelerated 3D) will work on speedy machines
too since the drawing rate isn't tremendous (hypviewer is mostly optimized
for interaction and does minimal drawing during user interaction).

This version of the H3/H3Viewer source has been tested to compile and
run on SGIs. The main library code should work across multiple
platforms. Device dependencies are segregated by #ifdef barriers.
Currently, the flavors that work are GLUT (Mark Kilgard's window
system independent toolkit) and ViewKit. I've started making an
Xt-only version, which should be quite similar to the Vk version, but
that's not ready yet. Both the Vk and the Xt versions use the GLX
defines.

The example application code has more device dependencies. Both the Vk 
and Xt versions are in the vk directory. The glut version is in its
own directory. There's also a simplevk app that's more barebones than
the vk version. 

Since I haven't tried compiling and running on anything but an SGI
yet, I'm sure there are a lot of unfound device dependencies. I got
most of the way through fixing the warnings/errors from using g++
instead of SGI's CC, but that's not quite finished either.

The GLUT version *should* work on Windows, just download the libraries
from http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/glut3/glut3.html. I haven't yet
tried compiling the code using VisualC++.

pack up source for distribution

* merge hash table and okds utility libraries into main source.
* completely revamp Makefile and directory structure. 
* clean up warnings.

The new Makefile structure supports multiple flavors.
Currently Makefiles will compile and run for the GLUT and ViewKit
flavors of code.
