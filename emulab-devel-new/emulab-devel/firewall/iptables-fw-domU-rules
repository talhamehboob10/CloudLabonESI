#
# Firewall rule template.
#
# Each line consists of an iptables or ebtables rule, a '#' denoted "comment"
# at the end of the line indicates a rule number to use, a comma separated
# list of styles to which the rule applies, and an optional qualifier that
# indicates the types of firewalled nodes to which the rule should apply.
#
# Styles:
#
#	OPEN		allows everything
#	CLOSED   	allows only Emulab infrastructure services
#	BASIC		CLOSED + ssh from anywhere
#	ELABINELAB	Elab-in-elab, eliminates many Emulab services
#
# Qualifiers:
#
#	WINDOWS		For nodes running some variant of Windows
#	SAMENET		For nodes that are on the same subnet as any
#			"control" host (boss, subbosses, ops, fs).
#
# Note that currently, we do not support the qualifier. Rules with a
# qualifier are applied unconditionally to the style which they are a part of.
#
# Variables expanded by rc.firewall script that can be used here:
#
#	EMULAB_GWIP	IP address of gateway
#	EMULAB_VGWIP	IP address of gateway on virtual node network
#	EMULAB_NS	IP address of name server
#	EMULAB_CNET	Node control network in CIDR notation
#	EMULAB_VCNET	Virtual node control network in CIDR notation
#	EMULAB_MCADDR	Multicast address range used by frisbee
#	EMULAB_MCPORT	Port range used by frisbee
#	EMULAB_BOSSES	Comma separated list of subbosses (including "boss"),
#			used for services that subbosses provide
#			(dhcp/tftp/frisbee).
#	EMULAB_SERVERS	Comma separated list of all servers
#			(EMULAB_BOSSES + "ops" + "fs")
#
# Currently these are sufficient for rules we use.  Note that you can
# safely use symbolic hostnames "boss", "ops", "fs", "users", "ntp1"
# and "ntp2" as they are all guaranteed to resolve, either via the local
# hosts file or via DNS (assuming the firewall is not yet up or allows
# DNS traffic, which it should at that point in time).
#
# For an Emulab in Emulab setup, the names "myboss", "myops" and "myfs"
# are also valid for naming the respective inner servers.
#
# Additionally, the tokens 'pdev', 'vlandev', and 'me' will be replaced
# with the physical control net device, the VLAN device, and the firewall's
# control net IP address respectively.
#
#
# NOTE!!! The basic firewall rules are set up on client during
#         container setup.
#

# Allow everything from the gateway, since the gateway may be part of the node control net
iptables -A OUTSIDE -s EMULAB_GWIP,EMULAB_VGWIP -j ACCEPT # BASIC,CLOSED,ELABINELAB

# On a non-segmented control network (like an IG rack), boss/ops
# have aliases on the virtual node network. Allows these though.
iptables -A OUTSIDE -s EMULAB_VCBOSS,EMULAB_VCOPS -j ACCEPT # BASIC,CLOSED,ELABINELAB

#
# No one on the inside can talk to other experiments' nodes and visa-versa.
#
# XXX currently we only do this for the heavier weight firewalls because
# the user cannot override this.
#
# Note that this does not apply to nodes within this experiment because
# those packets never come to the firewall.
#
# Note also that EMULAB_CNET is only the "node control net" and does not
# include the public/private nets for boss, ops, etc.
#
# XXX yuk!  The gateway *is* part of EMULAB_CNET, and assorted packets do
# come from it:
#  * IGMP and PIM traffic
#  * DHCP replies from boss appear to have come from the gateway
#    (due to the helper function).
# so for now we allow any IP traffic from the gateway.
#
#
# XXX yuk 2!  In a non-segmented control network or in a configuration with
# subbosses, some or all of the server machines will be a part of "the node
# control net" so we cannot unconditionally block all traffic to/from outside
# control net addresses. Here we allow through all traffic involving the known
# servers and let later rules further limit it.
