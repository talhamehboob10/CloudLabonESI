#
# Firewall rule template.
#
# Each line consists of an iptables or ebtables rule, a '#' denoted "comment"
# at the end of the line indicates a rule number to use, a comma separated
# list of styles to which the rule applies, and an optional qualifier that
# indicates the types of firewalled nodes to which the rule should apply.
#
# Styles:
#
#	OPEN		allows everything
#	CLOSED   	allows only Emulab infrastructure services
#	BASIC		CLOSED + ssh from anywhere
#	ELABINELAB	Elab-in-elab, eliminates many Emulab services
#
# Qualifiers:
#
#	WINDOWS		For nodes running some variant of Windows
#	SAMENET		For nodes that are on the same subnet as any
#			"control" host (boss, subbosses, ops, fs).
#
# Note that currently, we do not support the qualifier. Rules with a
# qualifier are applied unconditionally to the style which they are a part of.
#
# Variables expanded by rc.firewall script that can be used here:
#
#	EMULAB_GWIP	IP address of gateway
#	EMULAB_VGWIP	IP address of gateway on virtual node network
#	EMULAB_NS	IP address of name server
#	EMULAB_CNET	Node control network in CIDR notation
#	EMULAB_VCNET	Virtual node control network in CIDR notation
#	EMULAB_MCADDR	Multicast address range used by frisbee
#	EMULAB_MCPORT	Port range used by frisbee
#	EMULAB_BOSSES	Comma separated list of subbosses (including "boss"),
#			used for services that subbosses provide
#			(dhcp/tftp/frisbee).
#	EMULAB_SERVERS	Comma separated list of all servers
#			(EMULAB_BOSSES + "ops" + "fs")
#
# Currently these are sufficient for rules we use.  Note that you can
# safely use symbolic hostnames "boss", "ops", "fs", "users" and "ntp1"
# as they are all guaranteed to resolve, either via the local
# hosts file or via DNS (assuming the firewall is not yet up or allows
# DNS traffic, which it should at that point in time).
#
# For an Emulab in Emulab setup, the names "myboss", "myops" and "myfs"
# are also valid for naming the respective inner servers.
#
# Additionally, the tokens 'pdev', 'vlandev', and 'me' will be replaced
# with the physical control net device, the VLAN device, and the firewall's
# control net IP address respectively.
#

#
# Frisbee multicast with boss
#  * nodes mcast everything to boss (joins, leaves and requests): 60046
#  * boss mcasts blocks to same mcaddr/port: 60047
#  * boss unicasts join replies to same port: 60048
#  * node and switch need to IGMP: 60049
#
# Elabinelab should only do this to download an image from real boss to
# the inner boss.  Re-imaging anything else from outside would be a disaster.
# But note that the image is still mcast, so we cannot really differentiate
# in 60047.
#
# NOTE: the unicast join replies (60048) make our life miserable. We cannot
# use a keep-state rule because the request was multicast and not directed to
# boss. Thus we have to open up a wide range of ports from boss for the reply.
# To make matters worse, this wide range potentially overlaps with rule 60067
# which allows TFTP traffic. Since the latter requires bi-directional traffic,
# we DO need to specify keep-state on this rule. If we ever start mcasting
# join replies, we could get rid of rule 60048 (which is why it is split out
# from 60047).
