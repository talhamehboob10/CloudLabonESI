# XXX abuse of mapping function follows.
# The findcnet script DHCPs on all interfaces the first time it is invoked
# and uses the results of that for every other invocation.  The script
# returns "cnet" for the interface that is the control net, and the physical
# interface name for all others.

# The control network has been identified and configured indirectly
# via the mapping above.  Here we just make sure that if shutdown, we
# remove the indicator file so that we will re-DHCP next time.
