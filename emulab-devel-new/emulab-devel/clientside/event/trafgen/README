The current traffic generation application is based on the TG traffic
generator distributed by postel.org (http://www.postel.org/services.html).
We have made modifications to interface it with our event system.

The GNUmakefile should do everything necessary, but here is what happens
when building the trafgen application.

0. Note: you must first have installed and built the pubsub library
   for the event system.

1. Download tg2.0:

	http://www.postel.org/tg/tg2.0.tar.gz

2. Unpack in tg2.0 subdirctory:

	cd <testbed-srcdir>/event/trafgen
	tar xzf tg2.0.tar.gz

2. Apply the patch:
	patch -p0 < tg.patch

3. Thats it!  You should now be able to make trafgen.
