.TH INSTALL-TARFILE 1 "October 19, 2004" "Emulab" "Emulab Commands Manual"
.OS
.SH NAME
install-tarfile \- Tar file installation tool.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI install-tarfile
[\fB-hVdvctf\fR]
[\fB-n \fInodeid\fR]
[\fB-u \fIuser\fR]
.I installdir
.I filename
.P
.BI install-tarfile
[\fB-l\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B install-tarfile
utility is used to install tar files on an experimental node.  The "value"
added by this utility over using
.B tar(1)
directly is that it will avoid reinstalling tar files that have not changed.
So, it can be run repeatedly without performing unnecessary work or burdening
the NFS server with extra traffic.  Detecting a change from one installation
attempt to the next is done by checking the tar file's last modified time, and
if that fails, the MD5 hash of the file.  If both checks fail, or if this is
the first attempt, the tar file will be unarchived in the given installation
directory.  The utility will also automatically detect compressed files by
their file extension and pass the appropriate flags to tar.  The set of
extensions currently recognized are:
.I .tar.gz\fR,
.I .tgz\fR,
.I .tar.Z\fR,
and
.I .tar.bz2\fR.
Finally, if the installation succeeds, the timestamp and MD5 hash of the pair
(tar file, install directory) are stored in a file for future reference.
.P
Normally, this utility is automatically called on boot by the node\'s startup
scripts, but you may find it useful to update an existing installation or to
install a dynamically generated tar file.  The default set of tar files
installed by the node\'s bootup script is specified in the experiment's NS file
using the
.B tb-set-node-tarfiles
function.  You may want to consult the web based documentation for more
information about the use of this function.
.P
Required arguments:
.TP
.I installdir
The absolute path to the installation directory.  The utility will change to
this directory before executing
.B tar(1)\fR.
.TP
.I filename
The absolute path to the tar file to install.
.P
Available options:
.P
.TP
\fB-h
Print out a usage message.
.TP
\fB-V
Print out version information and exit.
.TP
\fB-d
Enable debugging output.
.TP
\fB-f
Force the installation to occur.  This option overrides the default behavior of
only untarring a file that has not yet been installed or has changed since the
last install.
.TP
\fB-v
Verify an installation and exit without attempting to install the file.  The
exit code will be one if the file is installed and up-to-date, otherwise it
will be zero.
.TP
\fB-c
Copy the tar file to the local disk before installation.  This flag is highly
recommended because it makes the installation resistant to NFS hiccups.
.TP
\fB-t
Use
.B wget(1)
to copy the file from Emulab in case NFS access is not available.
.TP
\fB-n \fInodeid
Override the default node ID when downloading the file from Emulab with
.B wget(1)\fR.
This flag is intended for debugging only.
.TP
\fB-u \fIuser
Specify the user name that should own any untarred files whose UID and/or GID
is greater than 100 and not a valid Emulab user or group.  For example,
tar files that were not produced inside Emulab might contain files with user or
group IDs that do not map to valid Emulab users.  By specifying this option,
the ownership of these files will be changed to the specified user.  The
default for files specified in the NS file is the user that swapped in the
experiment, which can be different from the user that created the experiment.
Note: the exemption for UIDs less than 100 is for pseudo-users that may yet be
created.
.TP
\fB-l
List the currently installed tar files and then exit.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.TP
255
If there was a problem with the arguments or a problem was encountered during
the installation.
.TP
1
If the tar file is already installed and is up-to-date.
.TP
0
If the installation was successful, or if the
.B -v
flag is specified and the tar file is out-of-date.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To install "mxc.tar.gz" into the root directory:
.PP
.RS
[kenny@node1 ~] sudo install-tarfile -c / /tmp/mxc.tar.gz
.RE
.PP
To verify the installation:
.PP
.RS
.PD 0
[kenny@node1 ~] sudo install-tarfile -v / /tmp/mxc.tar.gz
.P
[kenny@node1 ~] echo $?
.P

.PD
.RE
.PP
To list the installed tar files:
.PP

.PD 0

.PD
.RE
.RE
.SH AUTHORITY
You must be root to run this script.
.SH FILES
.TP
/usr/local/etc/emulab/rc/rc.tarfiles
The
.I rc
file that determines what tar files are to be installed on this node and then
calls this utility to actually perform the installation.
.TP
/var/emulab/db/testbed.tarfiles
The database of installed tar files, timestamps, MD5 fingerprints, and
installation directories.  This file is consulted to determine whether or not a
tar file has changed and the installation needs to be updated.
