These are some scripts used to parse testbed-ops and other testbed related mail
lists in order to extract experiment and node history.

These were used to extract information about experiments that happened before we
started keeping such info in the database.  As such, they are probably only of
interest to Utah and not to new Emulab sites.  parsemail.pl in particular has a
lot of builtin Utah Emulab history.

See the regen script for how all these scripts tie together.
