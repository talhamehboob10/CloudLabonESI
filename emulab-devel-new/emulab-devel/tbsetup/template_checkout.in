# Checkout a copy of a template. Do not be confused by the name; this will
# make a copy of a template in the specified directory and drop a little
# cookie so that we can tell later what template it refers to. It only works
# when called from ops (the directory specified resides on ops, there is
# no remote checkout at this time). Later, you can commit the template, which
# creates a new template (template_modify) and changes the cookie so that the
# current directory refers to the new template.
#
# Eventually support remote checkout via the web interface.
#
# There is no "update" operation, as with "cvs update" so you can easily
# muck up things by having two directories that refer to the same template!
