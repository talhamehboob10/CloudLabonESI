ipassign requires the METIS library.

Currently, ipassign is not compiled with the rest of Emulab. Until integration
happens, run 'compile.sh' in the 'tbsetup/ipassign' directory. The binaries
will be in 'tbsetup/ipassign/bin'

Note that 'compile.sh' assumes that the directory where the METIS include
files are kept is '/home/duerig/metis/metis/metis-4.0/Lib/'. also, it is
assumed that the METIS library files are kept in
'/home/duerig/metis/metis-4.0/'. If this is not the case, alter the shell
variables at the top.

To use 'compile.sh', make sure that there are 'ipassign/bin' and
'ipassign/tmp' directories to hold the various files created.

Until integration, this program should always be run from the 'ipassign'
directory and should be located (along with routecalc) in 'bin/ipassign'.
