This is the README for checkpass by Mac Newbold, Sept. 2000

Checkpass makes use of a modified version of CrackLib v2.7.
The modifications allowed for a string to be passed in with the password
line data instead of getting it from the password file. This remedies a
shortcoming of CrackLib, that it would not allow accounts being created to
have their passwords checked.
