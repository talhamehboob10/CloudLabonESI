    <em>PhantomNet</em> is a mobility testbed, providing researchers with
        a set of hardware and software resources that they can use to
        develop, debug, and evaluate their mobility designs.
        Resources available in <em>PhantomNet</em> include EPC/EPS software 
        (OpenEPC), hardware access points (ip.access enodeb), PC nodes with
        mobile radios (HUAWEI cellular modems), and a large set of commodity
        bare metal nodes, virtual nodes and other resouces inherited from 
        the main Emulab site. 
    In addition to raw resources, <em>PhantomNet</em> provides configuration 
        directives and scripts to assist researchers in setting up their 
        mobility experiments.
    Users specify their experiment via Emulab NS file templates augmented with 
        PhantomNet-specific functionality.
    In complement to these template NS files, 
        PhantomNet does the work of configuring the EPC software components 
        to operate within the underlying <em>Emulab</em> environment.
</p>

<p>
    The following factors drive the development of the PhantomNet testbed:
  <ul>
    <li>Exploration of traditional (EPC/3GPP) mobility platforms and variations therein</li>
    <li>A toolkit for expressing mobility experiments / setups.</li>
    <li>Access to and configuration assistance for real wireless hardware and mobile user equipment.</li>
    <li>Flexibility to go "under the hood" and modify/augment traditional mobility componts, or replace them altogether.</li>
  </ul>
