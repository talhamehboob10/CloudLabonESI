	  A reservation only ensures that at least the specified number of

	  Yes. You do not need to create an explicit reservation in order
	  to use node resources. Instantiating an experiment creates an
	  implicit reservation starting at the current time and extending
	  through the default duration of the experiment. If that time frame
	  conflicts with an existing reservation, the instantiation will

	  There are a couple of possible reasons. The most common reason is
	  that one or more of the desired node type has suffered hardware
	  failure or was otherwise taken out of service unexpectedly after
	  you made your reservation. It is also possible that the network
	  topology you specify in an experiment cannot be instantiated on
	  the set of nodes that are available when the reservation starts.
