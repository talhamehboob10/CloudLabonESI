      <em>Long-term</em> datasets are what you would think of as
      "persistent": they stick around for as long as they are useful; i.e.,
      they expire only after having been unused for a long time rather than
      at a fixed date, and then are locked down rather than automatically
      destroyed. Long-term datasets require administrator approval and thus
      need to be justified. Expect that we will send email asking you about
      it.

      <em>Short-term</em> datasets are for situations where you want to run
      a series of experiments over a short time period (days to weeks)
      using the same large data set but where local storage may not be
      practical because there is too much data to fit in a disk partition.

      <em>Image-Backed</em> datasets are the simplest kind of dataset; they
      are loaded onto your node into a spare partition or volume. In fact,
      an image backed dataset is an instance of an ephemeral blockstore
      that is preloaded with the data contained in the image file. This
      saves you the trouble of having to copy your data to the local disk,
      either from across the public internet or from one of the blockstore
      types above.
