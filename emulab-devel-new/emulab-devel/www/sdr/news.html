<h3>Jun 29 2005: SDR Wiki</h3>

<p>
  The <a href="https://users.emulab.net/twiki/bin/view/SDR">SDR Wiki</a> is
  ready to go!  We expect the amount of information in the Wiki to grow
  rapidly, now that the system is up and running.
</p>

<p>
  In case you don't already know, a Wiki is a Web-based collaboration
  environment.  The most important difference between a "normal" Web page and a
  Wiki page is that <em>you can edit a Wiki page</em>.  Wiki helps you write
  easy-to-read pages through the use of lightweight markup notations.  The
  "source code" for a Wiki page looks a lot like normal text instead of clunky
  HTML.
</p>

<p>
  Our Wiki system has a lot of built-in help, pointers to tutorials, and so
  on.  The <a href="https://users.emulab.net/twiki/bin/view/SDR">SDR Wiki</a>
  is currently open to the public, so if you have something to say about
  software-defined radio, you can start writing today!
