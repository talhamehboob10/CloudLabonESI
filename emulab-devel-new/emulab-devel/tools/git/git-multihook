# hook.

# To set up, set the config variables:
#     git config --add hooks.multihook.<hookname> <script>
# ... where <hookname> is the name of the hook that is being called (eg.
# 'post-receive'), and <script> is the other hook script you want to call.
# It's a good idea to give the full path to this script.
#
# You can run this command more than once to cause more than one other script
