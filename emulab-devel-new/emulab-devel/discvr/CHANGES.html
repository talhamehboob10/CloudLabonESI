	<b>Tue Jul 18 13:15:00 MDT 2000</b><br>
	Finished adding inquiry "class". The server now detects
	if an inquiry is a duplicate and, if from itself, ignores it;
	if from a neighbor, sends an interface list. This has not been
	well-tested.

	Cleaned up debug printing. Moved printing of interface info out to a 
	function. Removed misc debug printfs.

	<b>Thu Jul 13 17:00:57 MDT 2000</b><br>
	Implemented this in forw_reply.c:
	<pre>
	/* 
	 * It's possible that one neighbor responded very quickly
	 * and other neighbors (perhaps because they have many more
	 * neighbors whose messages they had to parse) could respond
	 * slowly. To cover this case, we should continue to try to 
	 * read from the socket until our delay is up. -lkw
	 */
        </pre>

	<b>Thu Jul 13 12:37:37 MDT 2000</b><br>
	Added TTL and FACTOR. This included changing select to use
	a loop since we might get more than one message for each
	interface (ideally, we only get one).
	Fixed print utility for replies to 
	print any number of <route, dest> pairs.
